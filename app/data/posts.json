Two passengers in the van were determined to be \"undocumented Indian nationals.\"<\/p><p>Conditions that day were blizzard-like with freezing temperatures.<br\/><\/p><p>After Shand and his passengers were transported to the Pembina Border Patrol Station, officers came across five more Indian nationals just a quarter mile south of the border walking toward the site of Shand's arrest.<\/p><p>The group had been walking for more than 11 hours and were expecting to be picked up by someone.<br\/><\/p><p>One member of that group told officers they had become separated from a family of four Indian nationals during the night. The man was carrying a backpack for the family that had children's clothes, a diaper, toys, and some children's medicine.<br\/><\/p><p>The next day, Royal Canadian Mounted Police alerted USBP that four frozen bodies had been found just across the northern side of the border.<br\/><\/p><p>The dead adults were identified as 39-year-old Jagdishkumar Patel, 37-year-old Vaishaliben Patel and their two children. Vihangi Patel, an 11-year-old girl and her brother, 3-year-old Dharmik Patel also perished.<\/p><p>Shand, who was released last year without bond subject to several conditions, has not been charged with the deaths of the Patel family.<\/p><p>He is charged with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-mn\/pr\/federal-grand-jury-returns-indictment-charging-florida-man-human-smuggling\" target=\"_blank\">two counts of human smuggling<\/a>, one for each person found in the van.<\/p><p>Shand's jury trial is set for July 17, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ndtv.com\/indians-abroad\/us-man-pleads-not-guilty-in-2022-indian-migrants-death-case-near-border-4072778\" target=\"_blank\">NDTV<\/a> reported.

And we're not going to reward people in Washington that don't do the job they're supposed to do,\" McCarthy said, summarizing pillars of the debt ceiling deal President Biden urged Congress to pass.<\/p><p>\"This is really a step in the right direction ... We let government grow, but at a slower rate,\" McCarthy said, adding that bill places a statutory cap on spending at 1% per year for the next six years.<\/p><p>President Biden characterized the bill as \"an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone.\" <\/p><p>Biden urged the House and Senate to \"pass the agreement right away,\" also outlining the \"catastrophic\" consequences of failing to reach a deal.<\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1662639703764484096\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\">\\u201cEarlier this evening, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement in principle.\\n \\nIt is an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone.

That can no longer happen. [President Biden's] got to cut in order to go forward,\" McCarthy said.<\/p><p>\"This is worthy of the American people,\" McCarthy also said, adding that he wants the citizens to read and understand the roughly 150-page piece of legislation. Similar bills, he said, have exceeded 1,000 pages.<br\/><\/p><p>Expanded work requirements for programs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acf.hhs.gov\/ofa\/programs\/temporary-assistance-needy-families-tanf\" target=\"_blank\">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families<\/a> and the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/snap\/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program\" target=\"_blank\"> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program<\/a>, at one point a \"red line\" for Democrats, McCarthy said, also appear in the bill.<\/p><p>Benefits for those programs will be expanded for veterans and homeless people, but sunset after seven years, McCarthy explained. He also clarified that the work requirements apply to \"able-bodied people with no dependents.\"<\/p><p>\"When you do that, it puts more people to work ... at the end of the day, that this puts our economy [in a] stronger [position], less dependent on China,\" McCarthy said, also criticizing Democrats' initiatives that have discouraged working.<br\/><\/p><p>Regulatory reforms are also part of the package, McCarthy said. One example he provided involved streamlining the process of getting approval for new roads or energy initiatives. The debt ceiling deal's regulatory reforms would cut the time frame for approval in some situations from seven years to one.<\/p><p>McCarthy said the pause on student loan repayments would lift within 60 days if the deal is signed. The move would bring $5 billion a month back into the government's coffers, he also said.<br\/><\/p><p>McCarthy described legislators on the other side of the aisle as \"upset\" about the deal \"because there's not one thing in the bill for Democrats.\"<\/p><p>\"It's a new day, it's a new Congress, and it's a new Republican majority,\" McCarthy said.<\/p><p>Some Republicans, particularly those in the Freedom Caucus, are balking at the deal. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) urged legislators to \"hold the line,\" emphasizing that the deal increases debt by approximately $4 trillion.<\/p><p>\"We could negotiate a 'deal' like this with a Democrat House majority. This would essentially be what they wanted,\" Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) tweeted.<br\/><\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

No one's responding to anything,\" said one Democrat to Politico. <\/p><p>\"The whole apparatus is not pushing back. Our side is just flat-footed,\" said a Biden ally. <\/p><p>Also on Friday, it was reported that negotiators were getting close to a deal that would raise the debt ceiling and allow for another two years of spending. <\/p><h3>Here's the latest on the debt-ceiling debate: <\/h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"86246080085403d3f53788db42c8f7cd\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rtjBSSkTHdo?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Debt limit negotiators appear to be closing in on deal, sources say<\/small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rtjBSSkTHdo\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com<\/a>\n\n        <\/small>\n        <\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?
