It's not the kind of epidemic that Anthony Fauci profits from, but an epidemic that is truly threatening our national security.<br\/><\/p><p>Since the days of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, the Pentagon has started focusing more on social experiments than on excellence. Woke liberals have made it their mission to indoctrinate cadets at our military academies with Marxist ideas, force transgender ideology on our troops, and claim that \u201cextremism\u201d is pervasive in our military. Their mission is simple: Transform our military into a weak, feelings-first social program that promotes leftist ideas. <\/p><p>We cannot let that happen. The true mission of the U.S. military remains: Win wars and act as a deterrent against potential wars.<\/p><p>The American military is the greatest fighting force the world has ever known \u2013 and the greatest force for freedom. While other countries try to conquer, America defends and liberates. And the men and women who compose our military represent the greatest forms of sacrifice and courage. <\/p><p>But the left views our military differently. Leftists put pronouns before petty officers, diversity initiatives before Devil Dogs, wokeness before warriors. In other words, they care more about programming and indoctrinating our men and women in uniform than they care about the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines themselves. It\u2019s shameful, and America deserves better. <\/p><p>Potential recruits clearly agree, and it is no surprise that the Army missed its 2022 recruiting goals by 25%. The Navy and Air Force missed their recruiting targets as well.<\/p><p>The United States needs real leaders to stand up to this nonsense and fight back. And I don\u2019t just mean posting a statement on Twitter. I mean real action. <\/p><p>First, we need leaders in Congress to defund DEI initiatives that have wormed their way into every corner of our military. The Pentagon is spending tens of millions of dollars hiring individuals whose sole job is DEI. That\u2019s absurd. That money should be immediately repurposed to pay for next-generation equipment that will defeat America\u2019s enemies. We need military members focused on actual warfighting \u2013 not making someone feel special. <\/p><p>Second, it\u2019s time for military commanders to be courageous and push back. Wokeness is rotting our military from the inside out, distracting from the actual mission of the Unites States military. We don\u2019t need political military leaders who are only worried about advancing their careers. We need officers to fulfill their responsibility to put the mission first and take care of the troops under their command. Commanders should find ways to minimize the nonsense on their bases, promote unifying leadership initiatives that lead to improving warfighting, and deliver blunt and direct feedback to their superiors about how the obsession with DEI is damaging our military.<\/p><p>Third, we need voters to make their voices heard. When the American people speak loudly, politicians are forced to listen. It\u2019s not enough for members of Congress to just say the right thing; we must hold them accountable at the ballot box based on their actions. Ask your congressman and senator: What specific actions have you taken to stop the work nonsense in our military? <\/p><p>Excellence is the standard in the United State military. We should accept nothing less. But when we allow leftists to make \u201cfeelings\u201d the standard, we are jeopardizing our national security. China, Russia, and Iran love it when America\u2019s military is distracted with drag shows on military bases. Enough is enough. It\u2019s time that the Pentagon refocuses on defending our country.<\/p><p><em>John Warren is a successful businessman, entrepreneur, and combat veteran who served as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.

Their pathetic lives have become entirely virtual. <\/p><p>Although undoubtedly exaggerated, \u201cWALL-E,\u201d in some sense, was oddly clairvoyant. <\/p><p>Our heavily digital world will likely become even more digital, as VR has been named the answer to many questions around sustainability. <\/p><p>With new \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives, travel and adventure \u2013 things that once made someone interesting and enviable \u2013 have been rebranded as selfish and myopic. <\/p><p>Why? Because airplanes and cars allegedly emit harmful emissions and pollutants into the air, and that certainly isn\u2019t in line with the various environmental protection movements gaining momentum across the United States and Europe especially. <\/p><p>\u201cThey are trying to get you to now look at traveling the world or the country as a bad thing,\u201d Glenn Becks explains. <\/p><p>He then tells the hypothetical story of Johnny, a boy who was born with wanderlust coursing through his veins. By the time Johnny turned 16, he was already making plans to venture to the moon, much to the dismay of his mother, who had been busy forming plans of her own. <\/p><p>One night, \u201cshe sneaks into her son\u2019s bedroom while he\u2019s asleep,\u201d Beck says, \u201cand straps [a VR] headset to him.\u201d <\/p><p>\u201cWhen he wakes up, he finds himself on the moon, and he never leaves his room again. \u2026 Johnny is safe.\u201d <\/p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what adventuring and exploring is all about? Safety?\u201d Glenn mockingly asks. <\/p><p>\u201cNow this sounds insane, but this is exactly where we\u2019re headed.\u201d <\/p><p>This theory can\u2019t be chalked up to mere speculation, either. There are seeds being planted to villainize travel right now. <\/p><p>In response to the Titan submersible tragedy, MSNBC released an article that read: <em>\u201cI think this tragic incident affords us an opportunity\u2013in fact, gives us a mandate\u2013to devise safe ways for people to satisfy their adventurous spirits and educational urges.\u201d<\/em><\/p><p><em>[...]<\/em><\/p><p><em>\u201cAs people consider safer ways to explore, I can\u2019t help but think this terrifying scenario is precisely why the concept of the Metaverse, that is a virtual world reachable through a wearable device, will never die.\u201d <\/em><\/p><p>\u201cThis is where we\u2019re headed,\u201d Glenn responds. \u201cThe death of adventure, the death of exploration in exchange for safety.\u201d <\/p><p>\u201cJust put your kid behind a screen or in glasses until they become the people of \u2018Wall-E,\u2019\u201d he criticizes. <\/p><p>Glenn wants us all to ask ourselves these questions this July Fourth: <\/p><p>\u201cAre giant corporations in charge?

The group <a href=\"https:\/\/ourrescue.org\/operations\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly<\/a> had a hand in the arrests of over 4,000 predators and the rescues of over 6,000 survivors and played a supporting role in over 1,000 operations.<\/p><p>This film centers on Ballard's transition from DHS agent to a private actor, saving missing children in Honduras and building his independent team.<br\/><\/p><p>\"What you see in the movie \u2018Sound of Freedom,\u2019 that was based on a real-life operation called \u2018Triple Take,'\" OUR Rescue president and COO Matt Osborne, a former CIA agent, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/sound-freedom-exposes-brutal-fight-rescue-victims-child-trafficking\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> Fox News Digital. \"In October of 2014, in three cities in Colombia, in a one-hour time period, we helped Colombian authorities and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security rescue 123 trafficking victims \u2013 55 of those were minors.\"<\/p><p>Caviezel plays the role of Ballard in the film, who Variety suggested comes across on screen \"as a beatific G.I.

Ron DeSantis. <\/p><p>The new law requires businesses with more than 25 employees to use the online database E-Verify to make sure their new hires can legally work in the U.S. Critics have argued that this system has been in place for many years but that politicians were afraid to require its use. <\/p><p>The law also forbids local governments from issuing identification documents to illegal aliens and requires hospitals receiving Medicaid funds to ask patients if they're in the U.S. legally. <\/p><p>NBC reporter Guad Venegas interviewed illegal aliens about their plans to deal with the new law. <\/p><p>Jesus, who has been a farm worker for 18 years and came from Mexico, told Venegas that he would work for as long as he could in Florida but would return to Mexico if officials forced him to leave. <\/p><p>Another illegal alien accused DeSantis of breaking up families with the new law. <\/p><p>Venegas appeared to interject his political opinion into his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CuIq9fwMt_G\/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram<\/a> post about the report. <\/p><p>\"These are workers who are ESSENTIAL to the Construction, Service and Agriculture industry. Many wonder if Ron DeSantis and state officials will be able to enforce the law,\" wrote Venegas. <\/p><p>The report quoted a finding from the Florida Policy Institute that said 47% of agriculture workers in the state were illegal aliens and estimated that it would mean a $13 billion economic loss for the state if the workers returned to Mexico or went to other states. <\/p><p>\"What the law has created is an environment of fear where people believe that they are risk,\" said Samuel Vilchez Santiago, the state director of the American Business Immigration Coalition.<\/p><p>The Pew Research Center estimates that there are as many as 775,000 illegal aliens in the state of Florida alone. <\/p><p>The governor's office released a statement to NBC News saying that the new restrictions were simply a response to illegal immigration. <\/p><p>\"Any business that exploits this crisis by employing illegal aliens instead of Floridians will be held accountable,\" the statement concluded. <\/p><p>Some have accused DeSantis of cracking down on immigration in order to bolster his campaign for the 2025 GOP presidential nomination. <\/p><h3>Here's the video of the NBC report:<\/h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8e502031fee6b4a7355329092277d841\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/BDIjXBucfYU?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">New immigration law in Florida creates panic among undocumented workers<\/small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/BDIjXBucfYU\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be<\/a>\n\n        <\/small>\n        <\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

We must not tolerate anyone coming into our country illegally, but the answer is to secure our borders, which I will do, rather than make unconstitutional promises,\" Hutchinson stated, according to the Daily Caller.<\/p><p>The outlet reported that Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said, \"Our Founding Fathers decided that people born here were immediately citizens.

According to <a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2023\/07\/03\/missouri-woman-amber-waterman-charged-in-death-of-unborn-baby\/\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a>, late last October, Waterman created a fake Facebook account under the pseudonym \"Lucy Barrows\" and began posting in a group designated for moms. As \"Lucy,\" Waterman told the group that she had a job opportunity, and 33-year-old Ashley Bush, who was then almost nine months' pregnant, expressed interest in it.<\/p><p>Bush and Waterman met at a public library in Gravette, Arkansas, on October 28 to discuss the position. Bush was later told that the supposed boss wanted to meet her and that she could travel with \"Lucy\" to Bentonville, Arkansas, for that meeting, but Bush never returned home from it. The last time Bush's fianc\u00e9, Josh Willis, saw her alive was on October 31, when he was supposed to pick her up from meeting with the supervisor. She was reportedly riding in the passenger seat of a pickup truck driven by \"Lucy.\" \"Lucy\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.5newsonline.com\/article\/news\/crime\/couple-kidnapping-murder-pregnant-arkansas-woman\/527-e2f64a1f-2639-471a-a75d-edba883d0229\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly<\/a> made eye contact with Willis as she drove on by without stopping. Willis soon afterward reported Bush missing. <\/p><p>When investigators looked into the Facebook account belonging to \"Lucy,\" they discovered that it had allegedly been created by Waterman, who said that she used to work with a woman named \"Lucy Barrows\" but that she had not been close with her. <\/p><p>Waterman had also already been in touch with 911 that same day to report that she had gone into labor suddenly and had given birth to a stillborn baby. When first responders found Waterman at a convenience store, she had the baby with her, but paramedics could not save the little girl. Waterman allegedly had the baby's placenta in her pants and had refused to accept any medical treatment for herself.<\/p><p>Waterman and her husband, Jamie Waterman, also 43, then held a funeral service for the little girl they had named Dakota later that same day. But the Benton County coroner also arrived after the service to take the baby for an autopsy, and the Watermans became visually upset when they learned that a DNA test would likely be conducted, police claimed.<\/p><p>\"Hands down craziest things I have ever dealt with as a coroner for 16 years,\" said McDonald County coroner BJ Goodwin.<\/p><p>Police now believe that Amber Waterman, who had reportedly endured four miscarriages, kidnapped Bush with the intention of stealing Bush's unborn baby and keeping the baby for herself. Her husband told police that Amber had shown him Bush's deceased remains and that she had attempted to burn them, court documents stated. The couple then allegedly  moved Bush's corpse to another location. Jamie Waterman led investigators to her \"charred\" body. Evidence also suggested that she had been shot.<\/p><p>Goodwin characterized the deaths of Bush and her baby as \"wickedness\" and \"evil.\" \"That's the only way to describe it,\" he claimed. He also noted that the baby appeared to have been \"cut out\" of her mother's abdomen.<\/p><p>Amber Waterman was initially charged with one count of kidnapping resulting in death. Now, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-wdmo\/pr\/pineville-woman-indicted-killing-unborn-child-kidnapping-victim\" target=\"_blank\">press release<\/a> from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Missouri stated that Waterman will also be charged with causing \"the death of a child in utero\" in connection to Bush's unborn baby. \"A Pineville, Mo., woman who was previously indicted for the kidnapping and murder of a pregnant Arkansas woman now faces an additional charge of killing her victim\u2019s unborn child,\" the statement said. The statement did not use the word \"fetus\" once.<\/p><p>Jamie Waterman has also been indicted with one count of being an accessory after the fact to kidnapping resulting in death. He supposedly attempted to help his wife dispose of Bush's remains \"in order to hinder and prevent [Amber's] apprehension, trial, and punishment, knowing she had committed the offense of kidnapping resulting in death.\" <\/p><p>Both Amber and Jamie Waterman have pled not guilty. Amber faces up to life in prison, and Jamie could face 15 years if convicted.<\/p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https:\/\/www.5newsonline.com\/embeds\/video\/responsive\/527-23b47883-e0df-4386-8ab7-37bfbb68795c\/iframe\" style=\"border:1px solid #e6e6e6\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\"><\/iframe><\/div><p><em>Like Blaze News?

He believes there\u2019s a much deeper issue at play\u2013an issue revolving around the ever-growing ethnic divide in France. <\/p><p>Levant reports that in Marseilles, half the city isn\u2019t faring well, particularly the Muslim half of the city, which Levant describes as \u201ca slum with many migrants\u201d from Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, and Turkey. <\/p><p>In this sector of the city, there isn\u2019t much French being spoken. Commerce looks very different than one would expect to see in France\u2019s oldest and second largest city. There are almost no women present, and the few who do roam the streets wear traditional abayas, even though France has banned face-covering veils. <\/p><p>But what Levant finds most unsettling is the fact that many of the immigrants who call Marseilles home openly identify with their country of origin over their new residence in France. <\/p><p>Levant spoke with several individuals and families about this issue. <\/p><p>\u201cThe French don\u2019t respect us\u201d and \u201cthe French don\u2019t treat us equally\u201d were among the common answers Levant received when he asked how they liked their new lives in France. <\/p><p>\u201cIn your heart, are you a French person first or an Algerian first?\u201d he asked several of them. <\/p><p>\u201cMost of them, without hesitating, said, 'Algerian,'\u201d Levant reports. <\/p><p>\u201cHow can you be upset that the French don\u2019t welcome you fully as an equal Frenchman when you yourself refuse to give up where you were?\u201d he asks. <\/p><p>Between France\u2019s declining birth rate and continued mass immigration, Levant thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time before Marseilles becomes \u201cmore like a Moroccan city than a French city.\u201d <\/p><p>Glenn agrees with Levant and expresses his growing concern about the rejection of assimilation going on not only in France but in other European countries and the United States as well. <\/p><p>Let\u2019s be clear, though, Glenn has a deep appreciation for American immigrants. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who <em>chose<\/em> America,\u201d he says. <\/p><p>\u201cI want immigrants\u201d who \u201c<em>want<\/em> to be Americans.\u201d <\/p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want an Italian coming in and saying, \u2018I want an Italian community, and we\u2019re going to have our own rules and our own ways,'\u201d he explains. \u201cNo. [Bring] your culture with you but become an American.\u201d<\/p><p>Perhaps the violence and chaos in France has more to do with pent-up frustration related to ethnic tension rather than an isolated injustice. <\/p><p>Listen to Ezra and Glenn\u2019s full conversation here. <\/p><h3><\/h3><br\/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"c6bee9df11c1cff1de34b0c56618b15e\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QEXNJt6418E?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span><h3><strong>Want more from Glenn Beck?<\/strong><\/h3><p>To enjoy more of Glenn\u2019s masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, <a href=\"https:\/\/get.blazetv.com\/glenn\/?utm_source=theblaze...%22%20target=%22_blank%22>\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to BlazeTV<\/a> \u2014 the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.<\/p>",

Multiple weapons <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/07\/03\/baltimore-shooting-brooklyn-block-party\/\" target=\"_blank\">were recovered at the scene<\/a>, and police believe there were at least two shooters. Law enforcement officers have not arrested anyone, and they don't yet know what the motive is for the shooting.<\/p><p>The lack of details did not stop Scott, however, from observing what he believes is a racial disparity in attention that shootings receive.<\/p><p>\"My community knows this: We know that when you think about this country in the history of mass shootings, most of the time when we talk about this, we're talking about it being a school in a rural community or a suburban white community. And when it happens in Baltimore or Chicago, or D.C., it doesn't get that same attention,\" Scott asserted in an interview on CNN.<\/p><p>\"These black American lives, children's lives matter just as anyone else. We're just asking for all of them to be treated the same,\" he continued.<\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rumble\">\n        <iframe class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"6b6557a9444f133f601b6928e7543a15\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/rumble.com\/embed\/v2v9sbk\/\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe>\n        <\/p><p>It's not exactly clear, however, where the disparity is for this tragic incident in particular.<\/p><p>In fact, every major news outlet \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/baltimore-mass-shooting-police-rcna92223\" target=\"_blank\">NBC<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/video\/abc-news-live-2-killed-dozens-injured-shooting-100611184\" target=\"_blank\">ABC<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/baltimore-brooklyn-mass-shooting-block-party\/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/07\/02\/us\/baltimore-shooting-sunday\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNN<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/fbi-announces-28000-reward-info-leading-arrest-baltimore-shooting-left-2-dead-dozens-injured\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/07\/02\/us\/baltimore-shooting.html\" target=\"_blank\">the New York Times<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/dc-md-va\/2023\/07\/03\/baltimore-shooting-brooklyn-block-party\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Washington Post<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/two-killed-dozens-injured-in-baltimore-block-party-shooting-df365422\" target=\"_blank\">the Wall Street Journal<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/baltimore-mass-shooting-block-party-july-4-5ccecae14842a53493ef91d6727f2a8c\" target=\"_blank\">the Associated Press<\/a> \u2014 has covered the story.<\/p><p>Perhaps Scott was referring to the fact that the shooting is not receiving wall-to-wall coverage in the media like other mass shootings. There is a reasonable explanation for that \u2014 and it's not because the victims are black.<\/p><p>Though police have not yet determined a motive, the fact that it occurred at a block party in which at least 200 people were in attendance, many of them teenagers and young adults, and the fact that there were multiple shooters and multiple firearms recovered suggests the shooting started as a dispute. This is typical of gun violence in major cities like Baltimore and Chicago.<\/p><p>Sensationalized mass killings, on the other hand, receive the attention they do because they often involve a killer who targets people at random in populated areas: schools, malls, grocery stores, and theaters. It's not because the victims are white or because they occur in rural areas, which is not always or even most often the case.<span><\/span><\/p><p>All murder is tragic and senseless. Gun violence <em>is<\/em> a problem. But the evidence does not suggest that this incident is receiving less attention because it occurred in a black working-class neighborhood and resulted in black victims.<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/woodtv-rebels-pride-coverage-memo\" target=\"_blank\">excerpts<\/a> of the memo, news station officials had received complaints from viewers who were upset by the station's supposedly fawning coverage of LGBTQ events. <\/p><p>\"We know that West Michigan is a Conservative area in many ways,\" the memo said, according to reports. \"We need to recognize that some stories related to LGBTQ issues are going to be controversial and polarizing in our community. While you personally may not agree with a certain position, people are entitled to their opinions, and they are our viewers.\"<br\/><\/p><p>The WOOD-TV <a href=\"https:\/\/thedesk.net\/2023\/06\/stanton-tang-amy-fox-lgbt-memo-wood-nexstar\/\" target=\"_blank\">memo<\/a> asked journalists to cover Pride events selectively, based on their \"newsworthy-ness.\" Should a story be deemed newsworthy, journalists should then make every effort to stay \"balanced and get both sides of the issue.\" Tang <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mlive.com\/news\/grand-rapids\/2023\/06\/4-fired-at-west-michigan-tv-station-after-news-leadership-ordered-scale-back-of-pride-coverage.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly<\/a> requested the memo, and Fox reportedly wrote and sent it on his behalf.<\/p><p>Newsroom staff apparently responded to the directive with a mixture of defiance and fury. Based on comments from unnamed employees quoted in <a href=\"https:\/\/thedesk.net\/2023\/06\/stanton-tang-fired-nexstar-memo-wood-tv\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Desk<\/a>, many staff members experienced significant emotional turmoil on account of the memo. \"The toxic atmosphere created by Stanton\u2019s behavior has had a profound impact on the well-being and morale of our team,\" one employee said in an email to the Desk. Another claimed that emotions at the station were \"still raw.\" A third employee, identified as a journalist, stated, \"This whole situation killed what used to be a very enjoyable job. I have no passion for it anymore.\"<\/p><p>Once the memo leaked to the media, WOOD-TV's parent company, Nexstar, immediately apologized for it, claiming that the memo was \"not consistent with Nexstar\u2019s values, the way we cover the news, or the respect we have for our viewers.\" Nexstar also insisted that its local stations are expected to report the news in an \"expansive and inclusive fashion.\" Nexstar representatives then flew to Michigan to conduct an investigation into the memo and to the individuals responsible for leaking it.<\/p><p>After several weeks of investigations, Tang and Fox were both dismissed. Tang is expected to be replaced by Steven Ackermann, who will fill the position on an interim basis.<\/p><p>In its reporting, the Desk slammed Tang, alleging that he reportedly had a long history of engaging in \"abusive and hostile behavior toward subordinates\" and that his \"anti-Pride Month memo\" was just the \"latest\" example of it. The outlet also hinted that Tang harbors extremist views, appearing to criticize him for following on social media noted conservatives like Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh of the Daily Wire. \"The anxiety at WOOD-TV caused by Tang turned a once-exceptional news team into a group that felt constantly under pressure, stressed and afraid,\" the Desk wrote.<\/p><p>In addition to firing Tang and Fox, Nexstar also parted ways with executive producers Luke Stier and Madeline Odle, who allegedly leaked the memo. Stier and Odle, who are expected to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.detroitnews.com\/story\/news\/local\/michigan\/2023\/06\/30\/grand-rapids-journalists-fired-after-criticizing-pride-month-memo\/70373659007\/\" target=\"_blank\">married<\/a> next month, were fired for supposedly \"breaking a corporate confidentiality policy.\"<\/p><p>The engaged couple made a joint <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LukeStier\/status\/1674773074653204482\" target=\"_blank\">statement<\/a> on Twitter about the dismissal. In the statement, they claimed that they are now \"reading the news instead of writing it.\" They also said they \"love\" the Grand Rapids area and felt \"heartbroken\" to be separated from their WOOD-TV coworkers, with whom they share an \"incredible legacy.\" The statement made mention of a \"non-compete clause\" which may prevent them from landing another job in the news industry.<\/p><p>Last Thursday, Nexstar spokesman Gary Weitman told CNN that the company had recently made some staffing changes to \"ensure its ability to continue providing outstanding local news coverage and service to the Grand Rapids community and surrounding area.\" But he also added that as \"these are internal personnel decisions involving matters of personal privacy, we will decline further comment.\"<\/p><p>Tang confirmed to the Detroit News that he had hired an attorney but did not comment further.<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

But their view is disputed by how rarely the six justices appointed by Republican presidents agreed in 6-3 decisions in the 2022-2023 court term.

Smith \u2014 who did not plan to start creating wedding websites until her case was resolved \u2014 would first have to get a request from a gay couple and refuse, triggering a possible complaint against her, the state argued.<\/p><p>Smith&#39;s lawyers maintained that she didn&#39;t have to be punished for violating the law before challenging it. In a February 2017 filing, they revealed that though she did not need a request to pursue the case, she had, in fact, received one. An appendix to the filing included a website request form submitted by Stewart on Sept. 21, 2016, a few days after the lawsuit was filed. It also included a Feb. 1, 2017, affidavit from Smith stating that Stewart\u2019s request had been received.<\/p><p>Two documents Smith filed with the Supreme Court briefly mention that she had received at least one request to create a website celebrating a same-sex wedding but do not elaborate.&nbsp;<\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/ap.org\/ac45ae56b8020ebacd8df42682d96d66\" style=\"height:5760px;width:8640px;\" alt=\"FILE - Lorie Smith, a Christian graphic artist and website designer in Colorado, right, accompanied by her lawyer, Kristen Waggoner of the Alliance Defending Freedom, second from left, speaks outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Monday, Dec. 5, 2022, after her case was heard before the Supreme Court.

The would-be customer&#39;s request was not the basis for Smith&#39;s original lawsuit, nor was it cited by the high court as the reason for ruling in her favor. Legal standing, or the right to bring a lawsuit, generally requires the person bringing the case to show that they have suffered some sort of harm. But pre-enforcement challenges \u2014 like the one Smith brought \u2014 are allowed in certain cases if the person can show they face a credible threat of prosecution or sanctions unless they conform to the law.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviewed the case before the Supreme Court, found that Smith had standing to sue. That appeals court noted that Colorado had a history of past enforcement \u201cagainst nearly identical conduct\u201d and that the state decline to promise that it wouldn&#39;t go after Smith if she violated the law.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cIf there are other places where you can get standing, then legally speaking I don\u2019t think it actually does make a difference,\u201d said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.&nbsp;<\/p><p>However, it could have affected the case by undermining the credibility of Smith&#39;s legal team, potentially causing the judge to look more skeptically at everything else they filed, Levinson said. It could also result in potential sanctions against Smith&#39;s legal team if it turns out they knew Stewart&#39;s request was false, Levinson said.&nbsp;<\/p><p><\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/ap.org\/af72db2634da475a36b4eae0b201c787\" style=\"height:5760px;width:8640px;\" alt=\"FILE - People on both sides of the debate rally outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Monday, Dec. 5, 2022.

He said Monday in his first public comment about the episode that it \u201cfailed primarily because the armed forces personnel have remained loyal to their military oath and duty.\u201d He said that the uprising had no impact on the war in Ukraine.<\/p><p>Dmitry Medvedev, head of Russia\u2019s Security Council chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Tuesday that the mutiny had not changed the attitude of Russian citizens toward signing up as professional contract soldiers in Ukraine. In a video posted on Telegram, he said almost 10,000 new recruits had joined up in the last week, with 185,000 joining the Russian army as professional contract soldiers since the start of the year.<\/p><p>In contrast, Prigozhin said that he had the public\u2019s backing for his \u201cmarch of justice\u201d toward Moscow.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday it saw \u201cno grounds\u201d to extend a deal that has allowed Ukraine to <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/russia-ukraine-war-grain-deal-black-sea-9b47d9d0b53e5ab0494c8eeea1197327\">ship grain<\/a> through the Black Sea to parts of the world struggling with hunger.

(AP Photo\/Matt Rourke)<\/figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">ASSOCIATED PRESS<\/div><\/figure><p>Saying the case \u201carises from Florida\u2019s latest assault on the right to vote,\u201d a federal judge Monday blocked parts of a new elections law challenged by voter-registration groups.<\/p><p>Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, in a 58-page decision, issued a preliminary injunction against parts of the law that would prevent non-U.S. citizens from \u201ccollecting or handling\u201d voter-registration applications and make it a felony for voter-registration group workers to keep personal information of voters.<\/p><p>Walker sided with groups such as the NAACP, the League of Women Voters of Florida and Hispanic Federation that argued the changes are unconstitutional.<\/p><p>\u201cFlorida may, of course, regulate elections, including the voter registration process,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cHere, however, the challenged provisions exemplify something Florida has struggled with in recent years; namely, governing within the bounds set by the United States Constitution. When state government power threatens to spread beyond constitutional bounds and reduce individual rights to ashes, the federal judiciary stands as a firewall. The Free State of Florida is simply not free to exceed the bounds of the United States Constitution.\u201d<\/p><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flsenate.gov\/Committees\/BillSummaries\/2023\/html\/3202\">The law (SB 7050)<\/a>, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in May, made a series of changes in Florida\u2019s elections system, particularly focused on \u201cthird-party\u201d voter registration groups. DeSantis and other state Republican leaders argued, in part, that the law was needed to ensure that elections are secure.<\/p><p>But voter-registration groups quickly filed lawsuits challenging the law and seeking a preliminary injunction. They said the groups play an important role in signing up Hispanic and Black voters.<\/p><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/opinion\/editorials\/article276970063.html\"><strong>READ MORE:<\/strong> Legislature considers additional election changes affecting mail voting, ID cards, more<\/a><\/p><p>The injunction issued by Walker applies to two parts of the law.<\/p><p>One part would require voter-registration groups to submit an \u201caffirmation that each person collecting or handling voter registration applications on behalf of the third-party voter registration organization is a citizen of the United States of America.\u201d Groups could face a $50,000 fine for each non-citizen collecting or handling applications, under the law.<\/p><p>But Walker backed plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the restriction would violate constitutional equal-protection rights.<\/p><p>During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Mohammad Jazil, an attorney for the DeSantis administration, pointed to concerns about voter-registration applications being turned in late to elections officials. Jazil argued that people who are not U.S. citizens, such as students from other countries or people who have temporary legal immigration status, \u201care not bound to the community\u201d and thus could be at risk for not turning in applications on time.<\/p><p>But Walker rejected the argument in Monday\u2019s ruling.<\/p><p>\u201c[The] state of Florida has identified a problem with respect to untimely submission of voter registration applications,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThe hard part for defendants [the state] is identifying any connective tissue between the problem and the state\u2019s proposed solution \u2014 namely, banning all noncitizens from collecting or handling voter registration applications on behalf of 3PVROs [third-party voter registration organizations]. At the hearing, defendants acknowledged the dearth of evidence connecting noncitizens to late-filed voter registration applications.\u201d<\/p><p>The other part of the law that Walker blocked would make it a third-degree felony if a worker for a voter-registration organization \u201ccopies a voter\u2019s application or retains a voter\u2019s personal information, such as the voter\u2019s Florida driver license number, Florida identification card number, Social Security number, or signature, for any reason other than to provide such application or information to the third-party voter registration organization.\u201d<\/p><p>Walker, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama, said the part of the law is too vague. For example, he wrote it \u201cleaves open a broad universe of what could be considered \u2018personal\u2019 information.\u201d<\/p><p>DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature have passed a series of controversial changes to elections laws in recent years.<\/p><p>Walker in March 2022 issued a 288-page ruling that blocked parts of a 2021 elections law. But a divided three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals this year overturned much of his ruling. Groups challenging the law have asked the full Atlanta-based appeals court to take up the case.<\/p>",

Spacey took &quot;who he wanted, when he wanted,&quot; claiming his &quot;preferred method&quot; of assault was to &quot;aggressively grab other men in the crotch.&quot; She said the star &quot;delights in making others feel powerless and uncomfortable.&quot;<\/p><p>Spacey&#39;s defense lawyer Patrick Gibbs kept his remarks brief, making it clear the<em> American Beauty<\/em> and <em>House of Cards<\/em> actor, 63, denies all allegations of nonconsensual activity.

Spacey worked there as the artistic director. &quot;He was almost, right from the get-go, grooming me,&quot; the man told authorities. Eventually, their interactions purportedly turned physical.<\/p><p>&quot;He&#39;d grab my hand and put my hand on his privates,&quot; the accuser said. &quot;I used to call him a weirdo. I used to say &#39;You&#39;re a f***ing weirdo.&#39; He used to laugh about it, he used to find it funny\u2026 he wasn&#39;t embarrassed.&quot;<\/p><p>Spacey&#39;s alleged victim called the actor &quot;an angry person,&quot; but &quot;charming&quot; at times. The man said he did not go to police sooner as he was &quot;embarrassed.&quot; He claimed the alleged abuse had caused him to suffer anxiety, stress and depression.<\/p><p>The trial began on Wednesday, June 28 with the official selection of the jury. Judge Mark Wall told the 12 jurors and two alternates that the case has &quot;attracted a lot of media coverage&quot; and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/kevin-spaceys-u-k-trial-093119370.html\">advised<\/a> them to &quot;rely on what you see and hear in this courtroom&quot; and not use &quot;your computer to research things&quot; or read about the case.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"Actor Kevin Spacey leaves Southwark Crown Court in London, Wednesday, June 28, 2023.

Under British law, it&#39;s illegal to identify accusers in sexual assault cases or to publish information that may lead them to be identified.\u00a0<\/p><p>During opening statements, Agnew <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/uk.sports.yahoo.com\/news\/kevin-spacey-labeled-sexual-bully-094907112.html\">outlined the allegations from the accusers<\/a>, none of whom knew each other . She said three of the men told police that Spacey grabbed their crotch; one said Spacey repeatedly put the man&#39;s hands onto his own crotch. Agnew said: \u201cNone of the men wanted to be touched by Kevin Spacey Fowler in a sexual way but he doesn\u2019t seem to have cared very much for their feelings. He did what he wanted to do for his own personal sexual gratification.\u201d<\/p><p>One accuser claimed he &quot;fell asleep or passed out&quot; while having a drink with Spacey at Spacey&#39;s apartment and woke up to find the actor had allegedly unzipped his pants and was performing oral sex on him. He claimed he said no and Spacey continued, so he pushed him off. Agnew claimed Spacey told the man not to tell anyone what happened; the man left and broke down in tears at a bus stop.<\/p><p>Another accuser, who was about 28 at the time, said he was seated near Spacey at Haymarket Theatre when the star asked him if they had previously &quot;f***ed.&quot; The &quot;shocked&quot; plaintiff initially ignored the remarks, but Spacey then put his hand on his leg. He said the assault took place later backstage when Spacey \u201cgrabbed [his] penis with such force it was painful.&quot; When the person told Spacey to stop, the star allegedly laughed and said the man&#39;s anger was a turn on.<\/p><p>Another accuser was a driver, aged between 30 and 34 at the time, for Spacey. He claimed he experienced &quot;unwanted touching&quot; by the actor, who would sit in the front seat. The contact became more aggressive with Spacey&#39;s later grabbing and groping the man.<\/p><p>The final accuser said Spacey kissed his neck twice and grabbed his crotch when they were in a pub near Oxford in 2013. He claimed he pushed Spacey off him and against a wall.<\/p><p>The time period of the alleged assaults coincides with when Spacey served as artistic director of London\u2019s historic Old Vic theater, from 2004 to 2015. His tenure later resulted in<a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/old-vic-theater-logs-20-125951697.html\"> 20 complaints of alleged \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d<\/a> by the actor, who starred in many of the theater&#39;s productions.

The architects of the program couldn&#39;t possibly have foreseen that there would be a baby boom following a Second World War. The results of that baby boom are currently taking their toll on Social Security, with an estimated 70 million boomers retiring between 2010 and 2030. This amounts to a huge increase in the amount of Social Security beneficiaries. To properly pay out these beneficiaries based on the original formulas, additional revenue is needed by the program.<\/span><\/p><\/div><div class=\"gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_gobankingrates_57\/b716259f47b2277406e9ececeff2706d\" data-uuid=\"408ceefa-2c12-36f1-ac7d-bdb5166f00ec\"><figcaption>KatarzynaBialasiewicz \/ Getty Images\/iStockphoto<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Not Enough Workers<\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The flip side of the &quot;too many beneficiaries&quot; problem with Social Security is the &quot;not enough workers&quot; problem. As the baby boom has pushed a significant increase of beneficiaries into the system, the worker-to-beneficiary ratio is falling. The Social Security Trustees expect the ratio to drop from its current 2.8 to 2.1 by 2035. If this ratio continues to drop -- or even if it just remains at 2.1 -- Social Security will essentially be permanently underfunded.<\/span><\/p><\/div><div class=\"gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_gobankingrates_57\/5e8862540ca6503424bdd8048a3d368b\" data-uuid=\"d3adb423-8b66-3aa6-8273-79e9d22ae4f8\"><figcaption>RgStudio \/ Getty Images<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Wealthier Individuals Live Longer<\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">An additional problem that&#39;s related to the longevity issue is that wealthier individuals tend to live longer, thanks in part to greater access to healthcare and white-collar jobs. As Social Security benefits are calculated based on the 35 highest-earning years of a beneficiary, wealthy retirees are paid more benefits than lower-income participants. With a higher number of wealthy beneficiaries in the system, benefits are paid out more rapidly, acting as a further drain on Social Security reserves.<\/span><\/p><\/div><div class=\"gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_gobankingrates_57\/2a82ccb9ae0c48cd3a13eafec641b9ec\" data-uuid=\"1d5f3eb5-ec64-3acf-9271-799179379e3e\"><figcaption>DNY59 \/ Getty Images\/iStockphoto<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>The Federal Reserve<\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Part of the reason that interest rates remained so low for so long is the Federal Reserve. Although the Fed doesn&#39;t directly control market interest rates, it does set the federal funds rate, off which many other rates are based. The federal funds rate was near zero from April 2020 until March 2022, when the Fed began increasing rates to curb inflation. Long periods of low rates spell bad news for the Social Security program, which needs higher interest rates to help it meet its payout requirements.<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Retirement Savings: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/retirement\/planning\/retirement-savings-experts-magic-number-key\/?utm_term=related_link_6&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=8&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\">Experts Say This Magic Number Is the Key -- and It&#39;s Not $1 Million<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><div class=\"gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_gobankingrates_57\/82f626887934b35efa61dd8b4fdfe83c\" data-uuid=\"2ba88b7a-fc55-3c9f-94ec-7c488f93c7b5\"><figcaption>svetikd \/ Getty Images<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Can&#39;t Grow Its Way Out<\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">While higher economic growth translates to higher net revenues, the Treasury Department has stated that the U.S. can&#39;t grow its way out of its Social Security problem. While acknowledging that increased economic growth will certainly help the program, the Treasury Department states that taking action now to reform the program will result in a gradual transition to something more sustainable. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Otherwise, drastic actions will have to be taken when the Social Security fund reaches its anticipated exhaustion date in 2035, after which continuing tax income will cover just 80% of scheduled benefits, according to a December 2022 report from the Social Security Administration&#39;s chief actuaries.<\/span><\/p><\/div><div class=\"gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_gobankingrates_57\/ce52a210e0f415e48ac5cff51b93fc65\" data-uuid=\"237c9764-3694-3122-bfde-253cf3dc8ec5\"><figcaption>Juanmonino \/ Getty Images<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Economic Contraction Hurts<\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The economic disaster that accompanied the coronavirus pandemic didn&#39;t just hurt workers and businesses. The Social Security program also suffered. Unemployment rates skyrocketed in 2020 and didn&#39;t return to pre-pandemic levels until July 2022, and in August 2022 the size of the labor force was still slightly diminished. As a result, there simply weren&#39;t enough workers kicking in to Social Security. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">With fewer workers earning a wage and contributing payroll taxes, Social Security revenues have been dramatically lowered. This &quot;black swan&quot; event appears to be receding, and payroll taxes are anticipated to eventually normalize, but nothing can make up for the payroll taxes that were lost during the pandemic.<\/span><\/p><\/div><div class=\"gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_gobankingrates_57\/394dfd61c5e996d278a45e7891ec03dc\" data-uuid=\"5996b4e0-98d3-3f89-8466-6701da995f08\"><figcaption>NoDerog \/ Getty Images\/iStockphoto<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Congressional Stalemate<\/h2><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In the midst of all of these structural problems with Social Security, there&#39;s also a major political one. While congressional leaders love to talk about the need to &quot;fix&quot; Social Security, little has been done. Plenty of proposals have been bandied about, from increasing the Social Security retirement age to permanently cutting benefits or increasing the payroll tax. Yet, as of January 2023, no major adjustments to Social Security have been enacted.<\/span><\/p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p><p><strong>More From GOBankingRates<\/strong><\/p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/money\/making-money\/ways-to-earn-money-on-fiverr-with-chatgpt\/?utm_term=incontent_link_3&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=9&amp;utm_medium=rss\">8 Ways To Earn Money on Fiverr With ChatGPT<\/a><\/strong><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/money\/economy\/places-to-live-in-europe-that-are-so-cheap-you-could-quit-your-job\/?utm_term=incontent_link_4&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=rss\"><strong>5 Places To Live in Europe That Are So Cheap You Could Quit Your Job<\/strong><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/top-alternative-investments-1270486\/?utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_5&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_content=11&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000<\/strong><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/money\/finance\/money-goals-easy-stick-year\/?utm_term=incontent_link_6&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=12&amp;utm_medium=rss\"><strong>Financial Goals That Are Easy To Stick To All Year<\/strong><\/a><\/li><\/ul><!-- \/wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><\/p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/author\/duhlig\/?utm_term=incontent_link_7&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=13&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\">Daria Uhlig<\/a> contributed to the reporting for this article.<\/em><\/p><\/div><p>This article originally appeared on\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com?utm_term=incontent_link_8&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=14&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">GOBankingRates.com<\/a>:\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/retirement\/social-security\/debt-free-future-biggest-problems-facing-social-security\/?utm_term=incontent_link_9&amp;utm_campaign=1235131&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=15&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">9 Biggest Problems Facing Social Security<\/a><\/p>",

The cost of sending a first-class one-ounce metered letter, for example, will rise to 63 cents and domestic postcards will jump to 51 cents. International postcards and one-ounce letters are both set to move to $1.50.<\/p><p>The Postal Service will also launch a new package shipping service, USPS Ground Advantage, on Sunday to replace and combine previous plans. Ground Advantage pricing will reflect a 3.2% decline in retail prices and a 0.7% drop for commercial, the Postal Service says.<\/p><p>The Postal Regulatory Commission approved both the price changes and the implementation of Ground Advantage ahead of this month&#39;s changes. The price changes had also been approved by the Governors of the U.S. Postal Service as of the Postal Service&#39;s April notice.<\/p><p>Sunday marks the fifth jump in forever stamp prices seen since the start of 2019, when the postage cost 50 cents apiece. When adjusted for inflation, 50 cents in January 2019 equates to about 60 cents in the spring of 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 CPI inflation calculator.<\/p><p>For the first quarter of 2023, the Postal Service\u2019s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/united-states-postal-service-district-of-columbia-louis-dejoy-business-36eee3de997fce11a9dae0f6852a76ac\">operating revenue was $21.5 billion<\/a> \u2014 an increase of $206 million, even though volume declined by 1.7 billion pieces, or 4.8%, compared with the same period last year. All told, the Postal Service reported a net loss of $1 billion for the first quarter, but that was a $519 million improvement over the $1.5 billion net loss during the same period last year.<\/p>",

Not for the crowds, which were large and loud, or for the players.\u00a0<\/p><p>The two top players at Wimbledon, Iga Swiatek (No. 1 seed) and Novak Djokovic (No. 2 seed), both survived the rain suspension and won their matches with little issue. Swiatek faced Lin Zhu, the No. 34 player in the world, and took care of business with a 6-1, 6-3 win. There were a few hard-fought games, but Swiatek came within a breath of handing Zhu a bagel for the first set. Not even someone loudly dropping a wine bottle on the ground during match point could shake her.<\/p><p>Djokovic, who appears to be focusing solely on majors at this point in his career, had very little trouble against Pedro Cachin, defeating him 6-3, 6-3, 7-6(4). The mid-match rain delay gave Cachin a bit of a boost, and he came close to forcing a fourth set, but Djokovic absolutely dominated him in the tiebreak. Cachin is ranked No. 68 in the world, so he&#39;s no slouch, but it was essentially a warm-up match for Djokovic. He faced a little pressure here and there and was challenged by Cachin&#39;s serving in the third set, but there was no doubt he&#39;d emerge with the win. And when he did, it was his 29th consecutive win at Wimbledon.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"Novak Djokovic celebrates after beating Pedro Cachin in the first round of Wimbledon on Monday at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.

Instead of hoping she could beat the odds and make it to Round 2, most people were just hoping she wasn&#39;t seriously injured and could finish the match.\u00a0<\/p><p>Williams did finish the match and didn&#39;t seem to be hurting too much, and she even made a late surge in the second set, but she didn&#39;t prevail. Svitolina, at her second Grand Slam since giving birth to her first child in October 2022, won 6-4, 6-3, with Williams losing on a line challenge.\u00a0<\/p><p>We don&#39;t know the next time we&#39;ll see Venus on the court.

        "title": "Harvard 'legacy' policy challenged on heels of affirmative action ruling",
        "description": "<p>By Daniel Wiessner&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reuters) -Three civil rights groups filed a complaint against Harvard on Monday, claiming its preferential policy for undergraduate applicants with family ties to the elite school overwhelmingly benefits white students, days after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down its race-conscious admissions policies.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education claiming that Harvard&#39;s preferences for &quot;legacy&quot; applicants violates a federal law banning race discrimination for programs that receive federal funds, as virtually all U.S. colleges and universities do.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, the Supreme Court said race-conscious policies adopted by Harvard University and the University of North Carolina to ensure that more non-white students are admitted are unconstitutional. The decision was a major blow to efforts to attract diverse student bodies and is expected to prompt new challenges to admission policies.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvard College is the undergraduate school of Harvard University.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The groups in Monday&#39;s complaint said the Supreme Court ruling had made it even more imperative to eliminate policies that disadvantage non-white applicants.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The groups are represented by Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based nonprofit that describes itself on its website as working with &quot;communities of color and immigrants to fight discrimination.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, the group&#39;s executive director, said the Supreme Court last week made clear that any policies that disadvantage racial groups are unlawful by noting that &quot;eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your family&#39;s last name and the size of your bank account are not a measure of merit, and should have no bearing on the college admissions process,\u201d he said in a statement.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy policies, which are common at U.S. colleges and universities, have become increasingly controversial&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in remarks following las week&#39;s Supreme Court ruling, said schools should consider eliminating legacy policies because they \u201cexpand privilege instead of opportunity.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Several prominent lawmakers from both parties made similar comments. Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California, called legacy policies &quot;affirmative action for white people&quot; in a tweet.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Monday&#39;s complaint, nearly 70% of Harvard applicants with family ties to donors or alumni are white and are about six times more likely to be admitted than other applicants.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;About 28% of Harvard&#39;s class of 2019 were legacies, the groups said in the complaint. That means fewer admissions slots were available for non-white applicants who are far less likely to have family ties to the school, they said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The groups are asking the Department of Education to investigate Harvard&#39;s admission practices and order the school to abandon legacy preferences if it wants to continue receiving federal funding. Michael Kippins, one of the lawyers who filed the complaint, said in an email that Lawyers for Civil Rights has not ruled out filing a lawsuit against Harvard in the future.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Supreme Court heard the Harvard and UNC cases last October, a lawyer for the group that had sued the schools argued that eliminating legacy preferences &quot;would make Harvard far less white, wealthy, and privileged.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas appeared to agree, pressing Harvard&#39;s lawyer on why the school could not get rid of the legacy policy instead of granting separate preferences to non-white students.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer, Seth Waxman, told the court that there was no evidence that ending legacy preferences would lead to a more diverse student body.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Leslie Adler)&nbsp;<\/p>",

Sudo took first place this year with 39.5 hot dogs and buns.<\/p><p>Here&#39;s the nutrition breakdown from the latest weiner winner.<\/p>How many calories does Joey Chestnut consume?<p>According to the nutrition facts of Nathan&#39;s products, a serving size of one Original Coney Island natural casing beef frank contains 170 calories (according to the company&#39;s <a href=\"https:\/\/nathansfranks.sfdbrands.com\/en-us\/products\/hot-dogs\/natural-casing-beef-frankfurters-5-pack\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">website<\/a>; other varieties vary) and one of Nathan&#39;s restaurant style buns contains 130 calories.<\/p><p>That means for the 62 hot dogs and buns Chestnut gobbled down this year, the calories of the franks would have equaled 10,540 and the buns added another 8,060 calories &mdash; for a grand total of 18,600 calories consumed.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Last year, with 63 hot dogs and buns Chestnut consumed an even higher total of 18,900 calories. That&#39;s nearly six times the recommended daily average for a man his age and size.<\/p><p>For his record-setting year with 76 hot dogs and buns, his total would have reached a whopping 22,800 calories!<\/p><p>Nathan&#39;s natural casing beef franks also include 16 grams of total fat and 480 milligrams of sodium per dog &mdash; so one hot dog accounts for about 21% of your daily recommended values for each.&nbsp;<\/p><p>With 62 franks eaten this year, Chestnut&#39;s total fat and sodium intake equalled 992 grams and 29,760 milligrams, respectively.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Diets <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/how-to-reduce-sodium-salt-intake-tips\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\">higher in sodium<\/a><\/span> are associated with an increased risk of developing <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/blood-pressure-study-tips-may-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\">high blood pressure<\/a><\/span>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/food\/nutrition-education-resources-materials\/sodium-your-diet?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">major cause<\/a> of stroke and heart disease.<\/p><span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/hot-dog-eating-contest-stomach-health-side-effects-joey-chestnut\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\">What does a hot dog eating contest do to your stomach?

As with any competition, there will be losers, and all competitive eaters will eventually reach their limit &mdash; and they might not feel too good afterwards.<\/p><p>The side effects of such enormous binges vary based on the individual and the food being eaten, but as CBS News has previously reported,&nbsp;<span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/how-competitive-eating-affects-the-body\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\">side effects of competitive eating<\/a><\/span> can include nausea, painful gas, vomiting, heartburn and diarrhea.

        "description": "<p>HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. \u2212 Nancy Rotering once relished the joy of bringing her children to her hometown Independence Day parade \u2212 the same one she walked in as a child.<\/p><p>But that joy was shattered last year, when Rotering and thousands of others at Highland Park&#39;s Fourth of July celebration fled in terror after a gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle opened fire from a rooftop.<\/p><p>Tuesday, Rotering plans to lead her community in a solemn walk to reclaim the beloved parade route forever marred by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/10\/highland-park-parade-shooting-community-whats-next\/7819903001\/\">shooting<\/a> that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/05\/highland-park-victims-list-parade-shooting\/7806497001\/\">killed seven people<\/a> and injured nearly 50 others. There will be no floats and no performers.<\/p><p>The city is also expected to hold a remembrance ceremony in the morning, a community picnic in the afternoon and a concert and drone show in the evening, instead of fireworks. People are still sensitive to the sound of loud pops.<\/p><p>&quot;We had and suffered through a uniquely American experience on this uniquely American holiday, so to be working to celebrate freedom at a time when our nation is still allowing this kind of threat to be so pervasive is a difficult balance to strike,&quot; said Rotering, the 61-year-old mayor of the still-grieving community.<\/p><p>One year since the mass killing in this Chicago suburb, Highland Park residents and survivors are at different stages of grappling with the traumatic event and coming to terms with the new meaning of July 4th.<\/p><p>&quot;There are not only seven families grieving. There are dozens of people who are still struggling to recover from devastating and complex injuries. There are people who are bearing emotional scars and trauma from seeing things they never should have seen,&quot; Rotering said.<\/p><h2 class=\"presto-h2\">A complicated year in Highland Park<\/h2><p>Thousands of people <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/06\/highland-park-shooting-american-gun-violence\/7808978001\/\">were at the parade<\/a>. Many fled and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/in-depth\/graphics\/2022\/07\/05\/how-highland-park-shooting-unfolded\/7809154001\/\">sheltered for hours<\/a> as the gunman <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jsonline.com\/story\/news\/crime\/2022\/07\/05\/suspected-highland-park-parade-gunman-traveled-madison-wisconsin-afterward-robert-crimo\/7815967001\/\">traveled to Wisconsin and back<\/a> before being apprehended that evening. Everyone affected by the shooting has had a different experience, Rotering said.<\/p><p>The victims, ranging in age from 35 to 88, were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/05\/highland-park-victims-list-parade-shooting\/7806497001\/\">loving parents and grandparents<\/a>, including the mother and father of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/06\/toddler-parents-killed-highland-park-shooting\/7818629001\/\">an orphaned toddler<\/a>. Some survivors are no longer comfortable at large gatherings. Others moved away. Many, including Rotering, have experienced symptoms of PTSD.<\/p><p>For the Roberts family, the past year has meant countless hours in the hospital and in therapy, relocating to a wheelchair-accessible home and a delayed start to third grade for 8-year-old Cooper, who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/08\/10\/highland-park-survivor-cooper-roberts-school\/10285583002\/\">was paralyzed from the waist down<\/a>.<\/p><p><img alt=\"Cooper and Luke Roberts can be seen together in June, 2023.\" data-uuid=\"442e9026-d95a-3642-9dda-1d552f7c67ad\" height=\"1432\" id=\"12200520002\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590\/44c19f7bd3b8bfa678d022272270b5f9\" width=\"740\"\/><\/p><p>&quot;He can\u2019t be on the soccer team, bounce on the couch or wrestle with his brother. When he should be going to sports practice, he is attending physical therapy,&quot; Cooper&#39;s mother, Keely Roberts, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/f\/coopers-home\">wrote in a recent online post<\/a>. &quot;Yet, amidst the sadness, we are astonished by his resilience and hope as Cooper has started participating in Adaptive Swim Meets and is learning wheelchair tennis. We are figuring out new ways to participate in the world.&quot;<\/p><p>Survivor Ashbey Beasley, 47, said her 7-year-old son was diagnosed with PTSD and will have an individualized education plan at school this year. Her husband, who was not at the parade when the shooting happened, has struggled with guilt. They&#39;re acutely attuned to when other mass shootings happen in the United States.<\/p><p><img alt=\"Ashbey Beasley holds a photo of murder victim Eduardo Uvaldo outside of the Lake County Courthouse following a hearing for Robert E.

Beasley was preparing to have lunch with a fellow gun violence survivor \u2212 a woman who lost her son in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2018\/04\/22\/waffle-house-shooting\/540029002\/\">the city&#39;s 2018 Waffle House shooting<\/a> \u2212 when gunfire broke out.<\/p><p>&quot;Only in America can this happen,&quot; said Beasley, who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2023\/03\/27\/covenant-shooting-ashbey-beasley-highland-park-survivor\/11550772002\/\">spoke to reporters that day<\/a>.<\/p><p>About a week later, Beasley&#39;s son locked down at school after nearby Highland Park High School received a tip of a student with a gun. No shots were fired, and five students <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cityhpil.com\/news_detail_T21_R1008.php\">were taken into custody<\/a>, city officials said. The incident set off panic in the area and spurred heated debates on school safety, Beasley said.<\/p><p><span class=\"exclude-from-newsgate\"><strong style=\"margin-right:3px;\">Are shootings really &#39;out of control&#39;? <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2023\/06\/29\/us-gun-violence-statistics-4-of-july\/70342727007\/\" target=\"_blank\">US gun violence statistics to know this July 4th<\/a><\/span><\/p><p>Residents have also been divided over where to place a memorial to the shooting victims.<\/p><p>&quot;Some people want a memorial in a very public place where everybody sees it. Other people aren&#39;t as comfortable seeing it all the time,&quot; said Rabbi Adam Chalom, 47, of the Kol Hadash Humanistic Congregation in neighboring Deerfield.<\/p><p>Chalom and his wife were at the parade, walking behind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/05\/highland-park-parade-shooting-band-witnessed\/7806680001\/\">the Maxwell Street Klezmer Band,<\/a> when the shots were fired. Last month, his wife was at a restaurant when somebody popped a balloon \u2212 she dove under the table, he said.<\/p><p>The Rev. Quincy Worthington, 42, of Highland Park Presbyterian Church, said he often finds himself planning exit strategies. It&#39;s easy to give in to apathy when it comes to issues like gun violence, he said. Instead, his congregation has been focused on building community and reaching out to young people who may be isolated or struggling.<\/p><p>&quot;We&#39;ve been talking a lot about how it&#39;s not the big, flashy things that get the job done, but it&#39;s several people doing seemingly small acts of kindness every day,&quot; said Worthington, who is expected to speak at the remembrance ceremony.<\/p><p>Alan Freeman, 52, said Highland Park doesn&#39;t feel like the same community his family moved to eight years ago. He&#39;s looking forward to retiring and moving out. He thinks America is too polarized to be able to address gun violence.<\/p><p>&quot;I&#39;m much more interested in just whatever we have to do for ourselves, for my family, for our town, because nobody&#39;s coming to our rescue,&quot; he said.<\/p><p>Natalie Lorentz, 35, said she and her husband regularly think about the shooting. She <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/10\/highland-park-parade-shooting-community-whats-next\/7819903001\/\">flung herself onto her three children<\/a> that day as the couple to her right were fatally shot. For her, the trauma frequently manifests as anxiety.<\/p><p>On the other hand, Lorentz said survivor&#39;s guilt has forced her family to appreciate being alive. She was pregnant the day of the shooting and gave birth five months ago to twin boys \u2212 her fourth and fifth sons. When the babies were just 6 weeks old, the family went to California for vacation.<\/p><p>&quot;We have to live life to the fullest,&quot; she said.<\/p><h2 class=\"presto-h2\">&#39;We will not back down&#39;: Survivors turn to activism<\/h2><p>Many survivors have looked to activism as a form of therapy. Like many before them, they&#39;ve become close friends with survivors of other mass shootings.<\/p><p>Lorentz and her husband flew to Washington, D.C., 10 days after the shooting and have since made other trips to meet with lawmakers and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/13\/highland-park-uvalde-survivors-rally-washington-gun\/10031002002\/\">participate in marches and rallies<\/a>.<\/p><p>&quot;I do feel like it&#39;s become more top-of-mind for people,&quot; Lorentz said. &quot;At least I want to be hopeful.&quot;<\/p><p>Weeks after the shooting, Rotering testified at a Senate hearing on gun violence and called on lawmakers to reinstate the federal &quot;assault weapons&quot; ban that expired in 2004. She&#39;s long been an advocate for gun control: Highland Park passed a municipal ban in the wake of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/education\/2022\/12\/13\/how-deadliest-mass-shooting-sandy-hook-elementary-changed-americas-schools\/10812709002\/\">the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut<\/a>.<\/p><p>That ban didn&#39;t stop the gunman from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/05\/highland-park-shooting-suspect-motive\/7809069001\/\">purchasing weapons<\/a> from locations in the Chicagoland area. Using a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P 15 semi-automatic rifle, he fired 83 rounds into the crowd in less than a minute, Rotering testified.<\/p><p><img alt=\"Highland Park, Illinois, Mayor Nancy Rotering recounts what happened during a mass shooting in her city on the 4th of July during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the shooting and civilian access to military-style assault weapons in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on July 20, 2022 in Washington, DC.\" data-uuid=\"64ca22fd-508f-3e55-ab00-f994da8a0833\" height=\"2598\" id=\"10127356002\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590\/75ca29171fa063cf2ba79d8af91957f2\" width=\"3896\"\/><\/p><p>An Illinois grand jury <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2022\/07\/27\/highland-park-parade-shooting-suspect-indicted\/10167911002\/\">indicted the gunman<\/a> on 21 first-degree murder counts, 48 counts of attempted murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery.

He and his 15-year-old son had a positive experience marching in a suburban Pride parade last month, and they&#39;re ready to be in a big crowd again.<\/p><p>Lorentz said her family plans to have friends over for a backyard barbecue. Her older kids, 6 and 4, don&#39;t want to go to a parade. But she&#39;s been surprised they&#39;ve expressed interested in seeing fireworks. The family may attend the show in a nearby town.<\/p><p>Freeman said it&#39;s been odd having to register in advance for gated events.<\/p><p>&quot;You&#39;re not really celebrating independence at that point, right? It&#39;s a really odd juxtaposition,&quot; he said.<\/p><p>Hours after the shooting happened, Kisicki vowed she\u2019d be back for the parade the following year. A year later, her feelings have changed.<\/p><p>She thinks about the shooting constantly and tries to honor the victims through action.

So, she&#39;ll be in Boston this week visiting extended family.<\/p><p>As soon as she&#39;s back, she&#39;ll be hosting those Monday night phone-banking sessions.

But even in that scenario, you\u2019d assume the U.S. would enter level on points with Portugal, with a superior goal differential; it would therefore only need a draw to advance in second place.<\/p><p>The only route to calamity is if Portugal holds both the Netherlands and U.S. to draws \u2014 which actually doesn\u2019t seem outlandish after the Portuguese held England\u2019s A-team to a 0-0 draw in a July 1 tune-up match.<\/p><h2><strong>What will the USWNT\u2019s knockout-round path look like?<\/strong><\/h2><p>The Americans will \u2014 or should \u2014 be gunning for Group E\u2019s top spot, because it could earn them a Round of 16 cakewalk.

It can\u2019t meet England, Germany, France or co-host Australia \u2014 four of its top-five challengers \u2014 until the final. Those four are all clumped together on the strong side, along with Brazil and reigning Olympic champion Canada.<\/p><p>The USWNT\u2019s title path, therefore, will only go through <em>one<\/em> of those six teams.

Canada (+4000)<\/p><h2><strong>Why is the U.S. still the favorite?<\/strong><\/h2><p>The U.S. remains atop that list for two simple reasons:<\/p><p>1. While the depth of the field has swelled, no challenger has separated itself from the pack. England, the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:37;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/womens-euros-final-england-germany-soccer-183448098.html\">reigning European champ<\/a>, has also lost two of its top five players (Beth Mead and Leah Williamson) to ACL injuries. Spain\u2019s stars hate their coach, so much so that <a data-i13n=\"cpos:38;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/spain-womens-soccer-national-team-coach-jorge-vilda-resign-223356425.html\">some resigned from the national team<\/a> in September; and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:39;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/global.espn.com\/football\/story\/_\/id\/37852116\/spain-stars-miss-women-world-cup\">a few are choosing to skip the World Cup<\/a>. In short, everybody else has problems, too.<\/p><p>2. The women\u2019s soccer world consistently gets punished for doubting the USWNT, and has been conditioned to expect dominance even amid worry.<\/p><p>U.S. defender Kelley O\u2019Hara remembers hearing that doubt four years ago, even when, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:40;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/womens-world-cup-2019-favorites-uswnt-195356051.html\">as I wrote at the time<\/a>, the U.S. was \u201cpretty clearly the best team in the world.\u201d O\u2019Hara remembers all the hand-wringing about goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, and the questions about defensive frailties. \u201cI remember being so annoyed by it,\u201d O\u2019Hara said Tuesday. \u201cBecause I&#39;m just like, \u2018I know how good we are.\u2019\u201d<\/p><p>On the surface, four years later, they are no less assured. They have more resources, more institutional support than any other team in the world. They have a self-belief, an aura that is backed by decades of substance. It buoys them, and spooks opponents, and laughs in the face of external doubt.<\/p><p>Some will argue that the aura has dissipated since 2021. \u201cThere&#39;s not many teams that fear playing the U.S. anymore,\u201d Carli Lloyd, who now works as an on-air analyst for Fox, told Yahoo Sports last week. But one simple fact remains: Through eight editions of the Women\u2019s World Cup, since 1991, the U.S. has only lost four games. Four.<\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_yahoo_sports_800\/79d9e03679b4e237ab2eac84d798a808\" style=\"height:3969px;width:5954px;\" alt=\"Jul 1, 2023; Stanford, California, USA; (L to R) United States women&#x002019;s national team member Kelley O&#x002019;Hara (center) sounds the San Jose Earthquakes siren with teammates (L to R) Andi Sullivan and Alana Cook and Naomi Girma and Sophia Smith before the game against the Los Angeles Galaxy at Stanford Stadium.

They had to wait 12 years to defend their title (because of World War II), and also failed to advance from their 1950 group.<\/p><p>So, all three previous three-peat quests have ended without a single knockout-round win.<\/p><h2><strong>What is the USWNT\u2019s biggest flaw?<\/strong><\/h2><p>Here\u2019s the three-step explanation:<\/p><p>1. In many ways, the USWNT built its 2017-2021 dominance around Julie Ertz, a converted center back who became a one-woman thwarter of counterattacks as a defensive midfielder. She not only shielded the back four; she allowed the five players in front of her, plus fullbacks, to attack unrestrained by defensive responsibilities.<\/p><p>2. Ertz stepped away from soccer for 20 months, after the Tokyo Olympics \u2014 first to rehab an injury, then to have her first child, Madden. Without her \u2014 and without a comparable replacement \u2014 the U.S. had to restrain its attacking-minded players, or expose its defenders, or in some cases both. Its midfield has often looked unsettled and unable to control games.<\/p><p>3. <a data-i13n=\"cpos:41;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/julie-ertz-soaks-in-emotional-return-to-pitch-for-uswnt-shes-back-like-she-never-left-041006482.html\">Ertz is back<\/a>, but not <em>back<\/em>. She\u2019s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:42;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/uswnt-world-cup-roster-2023-153010848.html\">on the roster<\/a> because a return to her 2017-2021 form is the USWNT\u2019s best hope of reprising its 2017-2021 dominance. But, having only played four full 90-minute matches since returning in April, it\u2019s very unclear whether she\u2019s capable of being even 90% of her former self.<\/p><p>And so, it\u2019s very unclear whether the USWNT will be able to derive all the benefits that it used to derive from Ertz\u2019s presence.<\/p><h2><strong>What are the other flaws?<\/strong><\/h2><p>Remember the defenders who, as we just detailed, were occasionally exposed in Ertz\u2019s absence?<\/p><p>Well, the most reliable one, Sauerbrunn, won\u2019t be in New Zealand. Girma and Alana Cook are capable of deputizing, but neither has proven herself against the world\u2019s best. And their only backup is Emily Sonnett, who has started at center back just once for the USWNT (in a friendly versus Colombia) since 2016.<\/p><p>There are also plenty of valid questions about Andonovski\u2019s tactical acumen, and specifically his ability to build a coherent, rhythmic attack that isn\u2019t over-reliant on moments of individual brilliance from players like Swanson and Smith.<\/p><h2><strong>Who is this Andonovski guy?<\/strong><\/h2><p>He was <a data-i13n=\"cpos:43;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/vlatko-andonovskis-unlikely-path-from-macedonia-to-uswnt-coach-215908184.html\">born and raised in Macedonia<\/a>. After an unremarkable six-year playing career there, he came to the American midwest to try indoor soccer. From there, he began coaching indoor and youth soccer, which somehow qualified him to become the head coach of FC Kansas City in the club\u2019s inaugural NWSL season \u2014 largely because the club\u2019s owners already employed him as the coach of their Major Indoor Soccer League team, the Missouri Comets.<\/p><p>Hardly anybody in the women\u2019s game had heard of Andonovski. But he succeeded immediately. With Sauerbrunn as his captain, he won two titles in his first three seasons. Then, after two mediocre campaigns, and after the franchise was folded and moved to Utah, Andonovski jumped to the Seattle Reign.<\/p><p>Two years later, he <a data-i13n=\"cpos:44;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/uswnt-officially-hires-vlatko-andonovski-as-head-coach-who-is-he-and-whats-next-194521239.html\">got the single biggest job in women\u2019s soccer<\/a>, seemingly with endorsements from USWNT veterans, including Sauerbrunn and Megan Rapinoe.<\/p><h2><strong>What will Andonovski&#39;s World Cup starting lineup be?<\/strong><\/h2><p>Andonovski\u2019s preferred starting 11 heading to New Zealand appears to be this:<\/p><p><strong>Goalkeeper:<\/strong> Alyssa Naeher<br><strong>Right back:<\/strong> Emily Fox<br><strong>Center back:<\/strong> Naomi Girma<br><strong>Center back:<\/strong> Alana Cook<br><strong>Left back:<\/strong> Crystal Dunn<br><strong>Defensive midfield:<\/strong> Julie Ertz<br><strong>Central midfield:<\/strong> Lindsey Horan<br><strong>Attacking midfield:<\/strong> Rose Lavelle<br><strong>Right wing:<\/strong> Trinity Rodman<br><strong>Striker:<\/strong> Alex Morgan<br><strong>Left wing:<\/strong> Sophia Smith<\/p><p>There are several caveats. Andi Sullivan has been the nominal Ertz replacement over the past two years, and could retain her starting place. Further up the field, if Lavelle can\u2019t recover from her injury, Ashley Sanchez or Savannah DeMelo would be in line for more minutes.<\/p><p>And although Naeher is the presumed No. 1 goalkeeper, Andonovski has rotated Naeher and Casey Murphy over the past year; he hasn\u2019t yet publicly named a starter.<\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_yahoo_sports_800\/9a275436675d551fe9e2c08cf4994dd7\" style=\"height:5504px;width:8256px;\" alt=\"United States midfielder Lindsey Horan speaks during a press conference for the 2023 FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup United States Women&#39;s National Soccer Team (USWNT) Media Day at Dignity Health Sports Part in Carson, California on June 27, 2023.

At age 29, she isn\u2019t an elder. She\u2019s played at major international tournaments, but hasn\u2019t starred at them. She has far less experience, in every which way, than Morgan and Rapinoe \u2014 who co-captained the team in 2019 \u2014 and often doesn\u2019t seem comfortable serving as the team\u2019s unofficial public spokesperson.<\/p><p>But Andonovski has pushed her into more of a leadership role ever since the fall of 2021. Sauerbrunn recently referred to Horan as \u201cthe co-captain with me,\u201d and said (<a data-i13n=\"cpos:47;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0l050EqrbbM\">on the &quot;Snacks&quot; podcast<\/a>) that Horan would be taking the armband in her absence.<\/p><p>That\u2019s not to say that Morgan, Rapinoe, O\u2019Hara and others won\u2019t have key leadership roles. Morgan and Horan could even be co-captains.

        "title": "Biden's green hydrogen plan hits climate obstacle: Water shortage",
        "description": "<p>By Valerie Volcovici&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reuters) -     The Biden administration&#39;s climate agenda is facing an unexpected challenge in drought-prone Corpus Christi, Texas, where a proposed clean hydrogen hub would require the installation of energy-intensive, expensive and potentially environmentally damaging seawater desalination plants.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gulf Coast port is in the running for up to $1 billion available under President Joe Biden&#39;s 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create a regional hub to produce hydrogen, a low-emissions fuel made by electrolyzing water that can help decarbonize heavy-emitting industries and transportation.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A hydrogen hub would require access to millions of gallons of water \u2013 a challenge in Corpus Christi which is experiencing a multi-year drought.  While local officials say they can provide that water by constructing a seawater desalination plant, environmental groups and some local residents and lawmakers are lining up to oppose desalination sites.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It makes no sense to create a purported clean energy source that in turn destroys an entire ecosystem, threatens other economies reliant upon a healthy bay system, and usurps the water supply for residents,&quot; the Coastal Alliance to Protect the Environment, a Corpus Christi activist group, wrote in a letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, shared with Reuters.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reuters interviewed six researchers who study hydrogen as green power and had exclusive access to an analysis by Rystad Energy consultancy that showed that the Biden administration&#39;s vision of low-carbon hydrogen may run into a challenge that is itself exacerbated by climate change: water scarcity.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Producing hydrogen requires enormous amounts of fresh water in a world increasingly affected by climate-driven drought.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine of the 33 projects on the Department of Energy shortlist for the hydrogen hubs are in highly water-stressed regions, according to Rystad data.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Those locations include Southern California, Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico as well as Texas. Globally, the picture is even worse, with more than 70% of proposed green hydrogen projects located in water-stressed regions like the Middle East.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Most of the world&#39;s planned green hydrogen projects are to be located in water-stressed regions,&quot; said Minh Khoi Le, renewable energy analyst at Rystad, adding that this would create demand for more desalination plants.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Biden administration is offering companies up to $100 billion in tax credits and regions up to $7 billion in grants to build out hydrogen hubs to help reach a target of producing 50 million metric tons of clean hydrogen fuel by 2050.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The DOE will announce the hubs in September.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The DOE declined to comment on the Corpus Christi or other hydrogen hub applications, but pointed Reuters to the agency&#39;s funding announcement, which &quot;acknowledges that water consumption for H2Hubs could place additional stress on regional water resources.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox told Reuters that &quot;more water systems are considering desalination as source water becomes scarcer and treatment technology improves&quot; but did not comment directly about Corpus Christi.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Zanoni, the city manager for Corpus Christi, said the hydrogen project, if approved, all but requires the adoption of seawater desalination.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with around 100 million gallons of groundwater supply per day, the city is experiencing drought conditions and limiting the use of sprinklers and irrigation to once a week, according to its drought contingency plan.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is contracted to supply up to 25 million gallons of  water per day to major industrial users ExxonMobil and Saudi Arabia&#39;s Basic Industries Corporation, Zanoni said, and anticipates hosting at least a half dozen green hydrogen producers at the hub, each which would need around 3 to 4 million gallons of fresh water per day.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the city plans to add at least 70 million gallons of water per day of capacity, including at least 30 million from the proposed seawater desalination plant. &quot;That drought-proof source is really appealing to us,&quot; Zanoni said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WATER WARS&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;While the United States has hundreds of desalination plants scattered across the country to treat mildly brackish inland sources of water,  transforming ultra-salty ocean water into fresh water carries higher risk, some water experts say.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pumping the briny byproduct of desalination into Corpus Christi Bay could cost the fishing industry around $6 million per year by killing off seafood species like shrimp and Atlantic croaker, according to Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi&#39;s Paul Montagna, an endowed chair at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And seawater desalination plants are energy intensive and expensive to build and maintain, energy experts say. The Poseidon plant near San Diego, California - the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere  - cost over $1 billion to build and requires nearly $275 million in  upgrades to meet updated state rules to protect marine life that can get sucked into the intake pipes or are affected by the briny discharge from the plant.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In March, the EPA stepped in with a $170 million loan to offset the price spikes for local consumers.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corpus Christi first proposed seawater desalination in 2017 to supply its rapidly growing energy and petrochemicals industries.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has struggled to secure federal environmental permits and local support.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The EPA in January said it will not recognize a state-issued pollutant discharge permit for one of the proposed desalination plants on Harbor Island until Texas regulators conduct a more thorough environmental impact review of groundwater use and conservation efforts.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality  in September, the EPA said it &quot;continues to have concerns regarding reporting and monitoring requirements for total dissolved solids, chlorides, and sulfates.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, a local residents&#39; association from the Hillcrest neighborhood, a majority black area that is already home to refineries, filed a Civil Rights Act complaint saying the proposed Inner Harbor desalination plant would worsen pollution.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is seeking regulatory approval for three other desalination sites.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Errol Summerlin, founder of local environmental group CAPE, said the environmental costs of seawater desalination were too high, even if it is in support of a low-carbon fuel.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This plan would destroy an ecosystem to create an unproven solution to the world&#39;s climate crisis,&quot; he told Reuters.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brandon Marks, a regional campaigner for the Texas Campaign for the Environment, said heavy industrial users, not residents, have the most to gain from the proposed desalination plants.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A report released in November by consultancy Autocase Economic Advisory said that over the last decade, nearly 70% of the increase in water use in the Corpus Christi area came from industrial users compared to just under 6% from households, commercial uses, fire protection, public recreation, and sanitation.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The whole reason they are pursuing this water is to enable unfettered growth, which would not only harm the bay but harm communities of the bay area,&quot; Marks said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Zahn, chairman of the Port of Corpus Christi and a major proponent of desalination, said desalination plants could be a boon for the region, even offering the opportunity to sell water to the city of San Antonio, if there was a surplus.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We need desalination to bring in industry that brings us jobs and increases our tax base,&quot; he said. &quot;I think water is probably the number one issue in Texas and we have the ability to help Texas.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Suzanne Goldenberg)&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Seeking a valid U.S. passport for that 2023 trip? Buckle up, wishful traveler, for a very different journey before you step anywhere near an airport.<\/p><p>A much-feared backup of U.S passport applications has smashed into a wall of government bureaucracy as worldwide travel rebounds <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/video\/transportation-security-administration-pandemics-travel-and-tourism-us-department-of-28113d77ccab463d88bcf97c7744b8e0\">toward<\/a> record pre-pandemic <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/hajj-hospitality-mecca-construction-ce3c894d6f464aa70069be1a20f8ef5e\">levels<\/a> \u2014 with too few humans to handle the load. The result, say aspiring travelers in the U.S. and around the world, is a maddening pre-travel purgatory defined, at best, by costly uncertainty.<\/p><p>With family dreams and big money on the line, passport seekers describe a slow-motion agony of waiting, worrying, holding the line, refreshing the screen, complaining to Congress, paying extra fees and following incorrect directions. Some applicants are buying additional plane tickets to snag in-process passports where they sit \u2014 in other cities \u2014 in time to make the flights they booked in the first place.<\/p><p>So grim is the outlook that U.S. officials aren&#39;t even denying the problem or predicting when it will ease. They&#39;re blaming the epic wait times on <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/who-declares-covid-emergency-over-pandemic-8b6445735df5218b5d9d6ec32fa047ca\">lingering pandemic<\/a> -related staffing shortages and a pause of online processing this year. That\u2019s left the passport agency flooded with a record-busting 500,000 applications a week. The deluge is on-track to top last year\u2019s 22 million passports issued, the State Department says.<\/p><p>Stories from applicants and interviews by The Associated Press depict a system of crisis management, in which the agencies are prioritizing urgent cases such as applicants traveling for reasons of \u201clife or death\u201d and those whose travel is only a few days off. For everyone else, the options are few and expensive. <\/p><p>So, 2023 traveler, if you still need a valid U.S. passport, prepare for an unplanned excursion into the nightmare zone.<\/p><p>\u2018PLENTY OF TIME\u2019 TO \u2018WE\u2019LL STILL BE OK&#39; TO BIG PROBLEMS<\/p><p>It was early March when Dallas-area florist Ginger Collier applied for four passports ahead of a family vacation at the end of June. The clerk, she said, estimated wait times at eight to 11 weeks. They&#39;d have their passports a month before they needed them. &quot;Plenty of time,&quot; Collier recalled thinking. <\/p><p>Then the State Department upped the wait time for a regular passport to as much as 13 weeks. \u201cWe&#39;ll still be okay,\u201d she thought.<\/p><p>At T-minus two weeks to travel, this was her assessment: \u201cI can\u2019t sleep.&quot; This after months of calling, holding, pressing refresh on a website, trying her member of Congress \u2014 and stressing as the departure date loomed. Failure to obtain the family\u2019s passports would mean losing $4,000, she said, as well as the chance to meet one of her sons in Italy after a study-abroad semester.<\/p><p>\u201cMy nerves are shot, because I may not be able to get to him,\u201d she said. She calls the toll-free number every day, holds for as much as 90 minutes to be told \u2014 at best \u2014 that she might be able to get a required appointment at passport offices in other states.<\/p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford four more plane tickets anywhere in the United States to get a passport when I applied in plenty of time,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about they just process my passports?\u201d<\/p><p>THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT HAS A CULPRIT: COVID<\/p><p>By March, concerned travelers began asking for answers and then demanding help, including from their representatives in the House and Senate, who widely reported at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QOJSPjuQFp0\">hearings<\/a> this year that they were receiving more complaints from constituents on passport delays than any other issue.<\/p><p>The U.S. secretary of state had an answer, of a sort. <\/p><p>\u201cWith COVID, the bottom basically dropped out of the system,\u201d Antony Blinken <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qcras2-XhdE\">told a House subcommittee March 23<\/a>. When demand for travel all but disappeared during the pandemic, he said, the government let contractors go and reassigned staff that had been dedicated to handling passports.<\/p><p>Around the same time, the government also halted an online renewal system &quot;to make sure that we can fine tune it and improve it,&quot; Blinken said. He said the department is hiring agents as quickly as possible, opening more appointments and trying to address the crisis in other ways. <\/p><p>Passport applicants lit up social media groups, toll-free numbers and lawmakers&#39; phone lines with questions, appeals for advice and cries for help. Facebook and WhatsApp groups bristled with reports of bewilderment and fury. Reddit published eye-watering diaries, some more than 1,000 words long, of application dates, deposits submitted, contacts made, time on hold, money spent and appeals for advice.<\/p><p>It was 1952 when a law required, for the first time, passports for every U.S. traveler abroad, even in peacetime. Now, passports are processed at centers around the country and printed at secure facilities in Washington, D.C. and Mississippi, according to the Government Printing Office.<\/p><p>But the number of Americans holding valid U.S. passports has grown at roughly 10% faster than the population over the past three decades, according to Jay Zagorsky, an economist at Boston University&#39;s Questrom School of Business.<\/p><p>After passport delays derailed his own plans to travel to London earlier this year, Zagorsky found that the number of U.S. passports per American has soared from about three per 100 people in 1989 to nearly 46 per 100 people in 2022. Americans, it turns out, are on the move. <\/p><p>\u201cAs a society gets richer,&quot; says Zagorsky, &quot;the people in that society say, \u2018I want to visit the rest of the world.&#39;\u201d<\/p><p>FOR AMERICANS AND OTHERS ABROAD, IT&#39;S NO PICNIC EITHER<\/p><p>At U.S. consulates overseas, the quest for U.S. visas and passports isn&#39;t much brighter.<\/p><p>On a day in June, people in New Delhi could expect to wait 451 days for a visa interview, according to the website. Those in Sao Paulo could plan on waiting more than 600 days. Aspiring travelers in Mexico City were waiting about 750 days; in Bogota, Colombia, it was 801 days.<\/p><p>In Israel, the need is especially acute. More than 200,000 people with citizenship in both countries live in Israel. It&#39;s one appointment per person, even for newborns, who must have both parents involved in the process, before traveling to the United States.<\/p><p>Batsheva Gutterman started looking for three appointments immediately after she had a baby in December, with an eye toward attending a family celebration in July, in Raleigh, N.C. <\/p><p>Her quest for three passports stretched from January to June, days before travel. And it only resolved after Gutterman paid a small fee to join a WhatsApp group that alerted her to new appointments, which stay available for only a few seconds. She ultimately got three appointments on three consecutive days \u2014 bureaucracy embodied.<\/p><p>\u201cWe had to drive the entire family with three small children, an hour-and-a-half to Tel Aviv three days in a row, taking off work and school,\u201d she said. \u201cThis makes me incredibly uneasy having a baby in Israel as an American citizen, knowing there is no way I can fly with that baby until we get lucky with an appointment.\u201d<\/p><p>Recently, there appeared to be some progress. The wait for an appointment for a renewed U.S. passport stood at 360 days on June 8. On July 2, the wait was down to 90 days, according to the web site. <\/p><p>FRUSTRATING TALES EMERGE FROM THE TRENCHES<\/p><p>Back in the U.S., Marni Larsen of Holladay, Utah, stood in line in Los Angeles, California, on June 14, in hopes of snagging her son&#39;s passport. That way, she hoped, the pair could meet the rest of their family, who had already left as scheduled for Europe, for a long-planned vacation.<\/p><p>She&#39;d applied for her son&#39;s passport two months earlier and spent weeks checking for updates online or through a frustrating call system. As the mid-June vacation loomed, Larsen reached out to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QOJSPjuQFp0\">Sen. Mitt Romney<\/a> \u2019s office, where one of four people he says is assigned full-time to passport issues were able to track down the document in New Orleans.<\/p><p>It was supposed to be shipped to Los Angeles, where she got an appointment to retrieve it. That meant Larsen had to buy new tickets for herself and her son to Los Angeles and reroute their trip from there to Rome. All on a bet that her son&#39;s passport was indeed shipped as promised. <\/p><p>\u201cWe are just waiting in this massive line of tons of people,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a nightmare.\u201d<\/p><p>They succeeded. But not everyone has been so lucky.<\/p><p>Miranda Richter applied in person to renew passports for herself and her husband, as well as apply a new one on Feb. 9 for a trip with their neighbors to Croatia on June 6. She ended up canceling, losing more than $1,000.<\/p><p>Her timeline went like this: Passports for her husband and daughter arrived in 11 weeks, while Richter&#39;s photo was rejected. On May 4, she sent in a new one via priority mail. Then she paid a rush fee of $79, which was never charged to her credit card. Between May 30 and June 2, four days before travel, Richter and her husband spent more than 12 hours on the national passport line while also calling their congressman, senators and third-party couriers.<\/p><p>Finally, she showed up in person at the federal building in downtown Houston, 30 minutes before the passport office opened. Richter said there were at least 100 people in line.<\/p><p>\u201cThe security guard asked when is my appointment, and I burst out in tears,\u201d she recalls. She couldn&#39;t get one. \u201cIt didn&#39;t work.&quot;<\/p><p>FINALLY: A HAPPY ENDING<\/p><p>\u201cI just got my passports!\u201d Ginger Collier texts.<\/p><p>She ended up showing up at the passport office in Dallas with her daughter-in-law at 6:30 a.m. and being sorted into groups and lined up against walls. Finally they were called to a window, where the agent was \u201csuper nice\u201d and pulled all four of the family&#39;s applications \u2014 paperwork that had been sitting in the office since March 17. More than seven hours later, the two left the office with directions to pick up their passports the next day.<\/p><p>They did \u2014 with four days to spare.<\/p><p>\u201cWhat a ridiculous process,\u201d Collier says. Nevertheless, the reunion with her son in Italy was sweet. She texted last week: \u201cIt was the best hug ever!\u201d<\/p><p>___<\/p><p>Kellman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel, Santana reported from Washington, and Koenig reported from Dallas.

Garson even played at Bowie\u2019s final concert, in 2006. But it was his first run with Bowie \u2014 starting in September 1972 at Cleveland&#39;s Music Hall, which was the singer\u2019s first-ever U.S. show, and explosively ending at Hammersmith a little more than nine months later \u2014 that he acknowledges will always stand as his definitive experience of working with \u201cthe greatest individual rock star of that century.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cI was part of history in a big way, even with my small contribution, because I knew that in a hundred or 200 years, he was going be known \u2014 while a lot of other [musicians of that era] were going to go by the wayside,\u201d says Garson. \u201cIt&#39;s all about timing. It was the right moment for that thing to happen \u2014 and once something like that happens, it&#39;s good to go for 50 years. Every interview I&#39;ve ever done about David, it always comes back to some aspect of <em>Ziggy<\/em>.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"ba3faa8fa06d43ecb7a53d3164771ee1\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Fq8gG3pzMrU?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>But before we dig into Garson\u2019s stardust memories of the Spiders\u2019 final night onstage with their snow-white-tanned messiah, we must address Garson&#39; above-mentioned question: How <em>did<\/em> someone like him get to this point? In many ways, despite Garson and Bowie\u2019s differences, their alliance was truly meant to be.<\/p><p>\u201cI was playing jazz clubs in New York City, and in 1972 I got a dream gig with people who played with Miles Davis. I&#39;m at this jazz club on 69th Street in Broadway, and I see five people in the club. And I made $5. I said to my wife, \u2018Something&#39;s wrong with this picture! \u2026 I think I&#39;d like to go out with a rock band.\u2019 And the <em>next<\/em> night, Bowie called,\u201d Garson marvels. \u201cI just made my manifestation come true, by saying I&#39;d like to go out with a famous rock band. But when David called, I didn&#39;t know who he was.\u201d<\/p><p>As it turned out, experimental singer Annette Peacock, of whom Bowie, \u201can encyclopedia of music,\u201d was a fan, had recommended Garson to Bowie, after Garson had played on her debut album <em>I\u2019m the One<\/em>; however, Garson did not find out that Peacock was that \u201cmagic source\u201d until some 20 years later. Garson was about to teach a piano lesson in his Brooklyn home that fateful day in \u201872, with his toddler daughter present, when \u201cthe phone rang: \u2018Can you be at RCA Studios in 20 minutes? David Bowie wants you.\u2019 I was like, \u201cWho&#39;s David Bowie?\u2019\u201d Garson chuckles. \u201cBut something hit my brain and said, \u2018I gotta go.\u2019 So, I had the student babysit my daughter while my wife was working. When she came home and saw this guy with my daughter, she [was so angry that] she wanted to cut my you-know-what off!\u201d<\/p><p>Lackadaisical \u201870s-era parenting aside, it turned out Garson was right to follow his instincts, as it set him on a course that would enable him to provide for his family for decades to come. But he had no idea what to make of the scene when he entered the studio that day. \u201cI zoomed down to RCA. I walked in the room, in jeans and a T-shirt, and there&#39;s these Spiders from Mars and Bowie, all decked out as if they were going onstage \u2014 like, in the middle of the week! And I&#39;m thinking, \u2018Where the f*** am I?\u2019 I thought, \u2018Oh, maybe it&#39;s a freak show.\u2019 But even though I didn&#39;t know who David was and I didn&#39;t know his music, I had this gut feeling that he was great. ... I had been blessed to be in New York in the jazz scene of the \u201860s, but David was bringing something fresh, and I just had to be part of it. I didn&#39;t know it quite that analytically then, the way I know it now, but it was more just my gut to go with this guy.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"71276e4ebe87404d919f654294d254f8\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EaVm93q95fc?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>As it turned out, Bowie was operating on instinct as well. \u201cI auditioned, and seven seconds later, he says to me, \u2018You got the gig!\u2019\u201d Garson recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018But I didn&#39;t even start to play!\u2019 He just said, \u2018I could tell.\u2019\u201d<\/p><p>Garson then underwent a bit of an amusing glam-rock makeover. \u201cThey fixed me up good! They put me in a very cool tuxedo, but with a big gray flower and these crazy boots that went up high. I went to a store in Hollywood [to buy those boots], and Elton John was in the store, in 1972, so I should have known I was in the right place,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI was more conservative-looking than [the other Spiders from Mars], but little by little, I had the makeup on and I knew my role. \u2026 But I was not part of that world. I&#39;m <em>still<\/em> not part of that world. I wasn&#39;t privy to the drug world and what was going on. I knew how to stay out of sex, drugs, and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, because I just was interested in the music.\u201d<\/p><p>Garson was <em>so<\/em> interested, in fact, that when he started touring with the Spiders, he would duck out into the crowd whenever there was a song on the setlist that didn\u2019t require his playing, so he could observe Bowie from a fan\u2019s point of view. \u201cI would slip out to the audience in the front row and watch him. And I said, \u2018<em>Ohhhh<\/em>, this guy&#39;s a f***ing genius. This is fun. I&#39;m gonna enjoy this ride.\u2019\u201d<\/p><p>It wasn\u2019t a ride Garson could have ever prepared himself for. He says Spiders guitarist Mick Ronson, an \u201cunsung hero\u201d and \u201cone of the true gentlemen in \u2018n\u2019 and roll,\u201d made him \u201cfeel so comfortable,\u201d but he chuckles as he recalls socializing with his bandmates and their sophisticated associates: \u201cWe&#39;d be on the bus and David would start talking about religion or psychology or philosophy or art, and I felt like a moron. I&#39;d be sitting with him and [Bowie\u2019s friend] Brian Eno and I would think, \u2018No wonder they think we&#39;re stupid Americans!\u2019\u201d However, Bowie-mania was already starting to spread in the States, and Garson says it was at that very first U.S. Spiders gig, in Cleveland, that he realized \u201cthis was very different from a jazz club.\u201d<\/p><figure><img alt=\"David Bowie arriving for his final Ziggy Stardust concert on July 3, 1973.

I was left right there. All of a sudden, 3,000 people were storming the stage, and I was the line of target. I took off like I\u2019d never run before in my life. I thought, \u2018Holy shit, I better get outta here!\u2019\u201d Garson also recalls other mob scenes from \u201cthe Zeitgeist of the \u201872,\u201d like when fans would cling to the sides of their moving limousine or even attempt to chop off locks of Bowie\u2019s flame-orange hair to keep as souvenirs. \u201cI realized, \u2018Oh, I&#39;m in the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll world now. This very, very, very different from the jazz world. There are new rules for this game.\u2019<\/p><p>\u201cI was staying at places like the Beverly Hills Hotel, in a bungalow right next to Elton John and Perry Como,\u201d Garson continues, reminiscing about his sudden rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lifestyle change. \u201cAnd the <em>bills<\/em> that would get accumulated! The guys were buying cameras and fur coats, and I saw like 35 cases of champagne coming in. There was an entourage that had about 35 people. I thought, \u2018This is very different than a $5 jazz gig!\u2019 I had just played a week earlier with five people in the club. I had to make a big adjustment.\u201d<\/p><p>Of course, no one had to make a bigger adjustment than Davie Bowie, who\u2019d been trying to break through for years and had \u201ctested a lot of things out in the \u201860s before he found the Ziggy thing\u201d and became an international phenomenon. Bowie famously stayed in character throughout much of the 1972-73 tour, even offstage, but Garson, with whom Bowie shared a special bond, caught glimpses of the real David from time to time.<\/p><figure><img alt=\"UNITED KINGDOM - JULY 03:  HAMMERSMITH ODEON  Photo of David BOWIE, performing live onstage at final Ziggy Stardust concert  (Photo by Debi Doss\/Redferns)\" data-uuid=\"53b54ea1-aa4d-3c91-a65e-5df0b13366cd\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_yahoo_music_149\/dc02737cf1756ca45f0b2ae5c00fbf5a\" style=\"height:4947px;width:3236px;\"\/><figcaption>UNITED KINGDOM - JULY 03:  HAMMERSMITH ODEON  Photo of David BOWIE, performing live onstage at final Ziggy Stardust concert  (Photo by Debi Doss\/Redferns)<\/figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Debi Doss via Getty Images<\/div><\/figure><p>\u201cHe would drop that Ziggy persona around me,\u201d Garson recalls. \u201cFor example, no one knows this, but he\u2019d invite me up to his room at the Plaza Hotel and he&#39;d have a video machine, whatever they were using in \u201972, and he&#39;d start showing me videos of Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. And because he respected me and he knew I knew that world, he would do motions and say, \u2018How does this look? Does it look like I&#39;m capturing that? Am I doing this right?\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Wow, he really wants to know about American music and the great stars from here.\u2019 He figured I&#39;m from Brooklyn, so I would know. It was very humbling that he would ask me to do that, but the truth of the matter was, he wanted to know. And obviously he wouldn&#39;t be in the Ziggy persona then. \u2026 He \u2018broke character\u2019 for me.\u201d<\/p><p>However, as a \u201cspiritual being looking at another spiritual being,\u201d Garson says he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about Bowie\u2019s state of mind during this era, \u201cbecause getting stuck in any identity or character can mess you up for months. Actors do this all the time, and before long, they lose their essence. It&#39;s one thing to put on the costume, but it\u2019s another thing to take it off. And I think that worried David, because he had a high awareness level. That&#39;s the thing that separated David from most of the rock guys I knew, was that he really wasn&#39;t a \u2018rock \u2018n\u2019 roll guy.\u2019 He was brilliant \u2014 an intellect, an artist, a painter, an actor. He played the role. He found something where he could hide behind this character, which was very helpful to him at the time because he was nervous. It was the perfect solution for him, and he got recognized for it, so he stayed in it, just like an actor stays in a role. But he stayed in it a little too long. Yes, this show and this persona could have gone on for six months to a year longer than it did, but he cut it short at the Hammersmith in \u201873 because he\u2019d had enough of it. <em>Fans<\/em> didn&#39;t get enough of it, because it was just warming up. But he knew it would screw him up if he stayed in it any longer. So, he dropped it.\u201d<\/p><p>And that brings us back to July 3, 1973, at London\u2019s Hammersmith. Garson says he \u201cwas one of the only ones that knew that the guillotine was going come down, so to speak. I knew something was going down. I was told he was ending this thing. But I also knew I&#39;d be continuing with him.\u201d Perhaps that is why Bowie had transitional band member Garson open the now-legendary Hammersmith show. \u201cDavid asked me to play a medley of three or four of his songs from <em>Ziggy <\/em>before he came onstage; I was the guinea pig,\u201d Garson laughs. \u201cAnd I knew Barbra Streisand was in the audience and I was a Barbra Streisand fan, so when I played \u2018Life on Mars,\u2019 I played it in a way that I knew she would recognize, that maybe she\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, this is a song <em>I<\/em> could sing!\u2019 And <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A-lY952YrEw\">she ended up recording it many years later<\/a>. I had an agenda there, in that way, just because I wanted David\u2019s music spread into other areas. But I played \u2018Ziggy\u2019 and \u2018John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\u2019 and things like that, like an overture in a Broadway show. David told me he was nervous for me. I was very nervous myself.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"c9e87b7281624a94a0ea703054fb5910\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kcEEey418PA?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>Nerves aside, Garson admits \u201cpart of me was happy\u201d about the Spiders\u2019 early retirement, \u201cbecause I was bored. I needed to do some other music, and I got to play different on <em>Diamond Dogs<\/em> and <em>Young Americans<\/em> and <em>Pin Ups<\/em>, so I was able to stretch my wings. I was like David and got bored quickly.\u201d However, he was sad to part with his Spiders from Mars bandmates, \u201cbecause these guys were my friends.\u201d But Garson insists that Bowie\u2019s decision that he had to break up the band wasn&#39;t personal.<\/p><p>\u201cIt <em>looked<\/em> personal, but it wasn&#39;t,\u201d says the pianist. \u201cThis guy couldn&#39;t help himself. He had to move on and move on and move on. And I know that for a fact, because there were albums of his later on that I didn&#39;t play on, and it wasn&#39;t because he didn&#39;t love me; he just didn&#39;t hear, in his inner ear, me playing on that particular album. You have to respect the integrity of the guy, because he always had a vision. He didn&#39;t do it out of meanness. He just had to move on. He was always that way. He was impatient, because he couldn&#39;t help wanting to create the next thing. \u2026 He was the Miles Davis of the rock world, in that he had to change styles every few years.\u201d<\/p><figure><img alt=\"David Bowie performs his final concert as Ziggy Stardust at the Hammersmith Odeon, London.

The things that I had studied prior to meeting David, which was so much music \u2014 pop, fusion, country, jazz \u2014 David had the \u2018casting director\u2019 skills and gifts to pull them out of my head. It wasn&#39;t me as much as it was <em>his<\/em> genius, you know? And I always played the piano the way I thought <em>he<\/em> would play, if he could play as well as me. I played through his head. And I think that was what kept me in there so long. \u2026 David loved the fact that I could make his songs sound bigger and better in a way that resonated with him. His songs were great without me, but he was very open to wanting the whipped cream on the musical cake. I would try things thinking, \u2018He&#39;s not going to like this,\u2019 but there was nothing that I could play that didn&#39;t put a smile on his face. So, that really bonded us. Even though our worlds were different, the music and the creative process was very similar.\u201d<\/p><figure><img alt=\"Mike Garson warms up prior to his performance with &#39;Celebrating David Bowie&#39; in 2018.
