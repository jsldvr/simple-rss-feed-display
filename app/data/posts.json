He nearly drowned to death, but was left with no brain activity after the pool accident. Doctors allegedly recommended the parents remove the boy from life-sustaining measures because he would forever be in a coma. <\/p><p>The parents reportedly decided to keep the baby on a ventilator and feeding tube.

Lauren Boebert of Colorado is calling for people to boycott The North Face. The congresswoman's call for conservatives to target the clothing and gear company is apparently in response to the brand's promotion of the LGBT movement. <\/p><p>The North Face recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/the-north-face-drag-queen\" target=\"_blank\">released<\/a> a video featuring drag queen Pattie Gonia. \"Hi, it's me Pattie Gonia, a real-life homosexual,\" the drag queen said in a video, adding, \"today I'm here with the North Face. We are here to invite you to come out,\" the gay man said, pausing before adding, \"in nature with us!\" The video marks the company's second straight year featuring the drag queen in a video.<\/p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Csl3BZINw7v\/?hl=en\" data-instgrm-version=\"4\" style=\"background:#FFF; border:0;\n                border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15);\n                margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px);\n                width:calc(100% - 2px);\">\n            <div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n                <div style=\"background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n                    <div style=\"background:url(data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf\/\/42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB\/lQPb79drWOyJVa\/DAvg9B\/rLB4cC+Nqgdz\/TvBbBnr6GBReqn\/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I\/fZou\/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px;\n                        margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\">\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\">\n                    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Csl3BZINw7v\/?hl=en\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif;\n                        font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\n                        text-decoration:none;\n                        word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_top\">See on Instagram<\/a>\n                <\/p>\n                \n            <\/div>\n        <\/blockquote><script async=\"\" defer=\"\" src=\"\/\/platform.instagram.com\/en_US\/embeds.js\"><\/script><p>Boebert called for a boycott against the company.<\/p><p>\"Well, I guess North Face wanted to get a taste of what conservatives did to Bud Light and Target.

Trezevant is assigned to the criminal probe and is listed on court filings related to the search at Burke and Hurtak's home. <\/blockquote><p>Importantly, neither Burke nor Hurtak have been accused of wrongdoing. <\/p><p>Still, a judge must have agreed that federal investigators would have located evidence of a crime in the home because investigators had gathered probable cause for the search warrant.

The day was not especially hot or particularly dusty, and there was not a single tumbleweed to be found. But there was still danger afoot as a cow, which had escaped from an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wxyz.com\/news\/region\/oakland-county\/steer-on-the-loose-in-oakland-county-as-animal-rescuer-sounds-alarm-to-try-to-get-help-for-large-farm-animal\" target=\"_blank\">abandoned farm<\/a> six weeks ago, was spotted in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clickondetroit.com\/news\/local\/2023\/05\/23\/holy-cow-meet-the-cowboy-who-lassoed-a-runaway-cow-on-i-75-in-oakland-county\/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel pit<\/a> in Holly, Michigan, about an hour northwest of Detroit. <\/p><p>The male bovine, later identified as Lester, soon freed himself from the gravel pit and headed toward I-75, a busy interstate that extends from Michigan's Upper Peninsula all the way down to Florida. With John Wayne long gone and Clint Eastwood far from town, MSP troopers had to round up an usual posse, which included professional cow catchers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wxyz.com\/news\/its-been-crazy-meet-the-i-75-cowboy-who-roped-a-steer-in-now-viral-video\" target=\"_blank\">Ricky Littlejohn<\/a> and his fianc\u00e9e, Trina Resendez, who live about 100 miles away.<\/p><p>\"They called me and were like, 'Hey, is there any way you can help?'\" Littlejohn recalled. \"I was a little nervous about going because it\u2019s super dangerous to be on the highway and whatnot.\"<\/p><p>But when duty calls, a true cowboy answers, and Littlejohn, Resendez, other assistants, and members of law enforcement strategically placed themselves to try and steer the rogue steer away from the road. For several minutes, the suspect refused to cooperate and eventually \"managed to outsmart its advisories\" and made a daring move toward the highway, even as motorists traveling at speeds of more than 70 mph whizzed nearby.<\/p><p>A trooper used his vehicle to block traffic as Littlejohn and his trusty ride, Bucky, charged after Lester. Armed with a lasso and years of cow-chasing experience, Littlejohn got hold of Lester and brought him to a halt on the grassy median, while an officer on a four-wheeler cut off the escape route. Though Lester made one last attempt at freedom, Littlejohn ultimately held him by the rope and saved the day.<\/p><p>Littlejohn made it all look easy, but I-75 posed some unique challenges to the seasoned wrangler. \"When we started running across there, we got shoes on all of our horses and stuff, and it\u2019s like a skating rink when you are running across there,\" he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-12128241\/Cowboy-wrangles-runaway-cow-Michigan-freeway-riding-scene-heard-chaos.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=social-twitter_dailymailus\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a>. \"So we had to be really careful we didn\u2019t wipe out ourselves and keep everybody safe while we got the job done.\"<\/p><p>\"The bovine was not charged,\" MSP joked in a Twitter thread, \"and is back in the pasture with a story to tell all the other livestock.\"<\/p><p>Watch the video below and be sure to have the volume on:<\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1660684295390806017\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\">\\u201cAnd we know that if there are no pictures or video it didn\\u2019t happen\\u2026.\\u201d<\/div> \u2014 MSP Second District (@MSP Second District)\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mspmetrodet\/status\/1660684295390806017\">1684765940<\/a>\n    <\/blockquote>\n        <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\"><\/script><p><em>Like Blaze News?

The help is desperately needed, and the Biden administration does not otherwise appear up to the task.<\/p><p>Tennessee, Nebraska, Florida, Idaho, and Mississippi are among the red states that have stepped up to and into the breach, committing troops, law enforcement agents, support vehicles, and other resources.<\/p><h3>What's the background?<br\/><\/h3><p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott <a href=\"https:\/\/gov.texas.gov\/uploads\/files\/press\/Governors_Letter_Border_Support_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">wrote<\/a> to his fellow Republican governors on May 16, stating, \"We, as Governors, must band together to combat President Biden's ongoing border crisis and ensure the safety and security that all Americans deserve.\"<\/p><p>Abbott added, \"Join us in the mission to defend our national sovereignty and territorial integrity and send all available law enforcement personnel and resources to the Texas-Mexico border to serve alongside our thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers.\"<\/p><p>Roused by Abbott's letter, or perhaps just remembering the Alamo, 24 Republican governors led by Iowa Gov.

Republican governors are leading the way to address the border crisis by increasing fentanyl sentencing and increasing support for law enforcement interdiction of drugs, among other measures.\"<\/p><p>One week later, Abbott hosted nine of his fellow Republican governors for a <a href=\"https:\/\/gov.texas.gov\/news\/post\/governor-abbott-hosts-fellow-governors-for-border-security-briefing-in-austin\" target=\"_blank\">border security briefing<\/a>.
