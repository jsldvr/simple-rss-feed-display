This comes after the online star was apparently canceled for being a \"white male figure\" and \"monetizing kindness\" for his acts of philanthropy around the world.<\/p><p>MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, had haters and claustrophobes fuming when he posted his most recent video, which has amassed more than 65 million views in just the past two days. <\/p><p>He urged his 213 million subscribers to refrain from trying the stunt on their own, noting that the challenge had caused him \"<a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2023\/11\/20\/lifestyle\/mrbeast-cries-at-being-buried-alive-for-week-mental-agony\/?utm_campaign=nypost&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\">mental agony<\/a>.\"<\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"5738b240e7415d2f79751979a7a562cb\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7dYTw-jAYkY?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        \n        \n        <\/p><p>Though the stunt presented extreme risks, MrBeast accepted the challenge of spending a full week beneath the ground, with a number of cameras, a five-gallon drum of water, one briefcase of MRE foods, and another briefcase equipped with toilet paper and some weights.<\/p><p>In the video, Donaldson is seen being buried alive in a transparent casket, dressed in a suit with flowers resting on his chest. A total of 20,000 pounds of dirt was dumped on top of the casket, which presented initial fears over whether it would be able to bear the colossal weight. <\/p><p>Donaldson's friends were apparently in constant communication with him via walkie-talkie, checking to ensure that he was still doing okay at all times. But this did not prevent them from carrying out pranks and jokes in his absence, including eating a delicious steak dinner on his burial place.<\/p><p>Donaldson addressed the question of how he used the restroom in the casket by simply holding up a plastic bottle, filled with what appeared to be urine. He jokingly said that it took so long to bury him that he already needed to relieve himself before the challenge officially got started.<\/p><p>The major element of concern for Donaldson was that he might  experience blood clots in his legs when he tried to stand up following the challenge. However, he emerged from the casket unscathed by blood clots or any other physical ailment. <\/p><p>It was the psychological toll of being trapped in the underground box that proved the most challenging. <\/p><p>There were a number of times that he broke down in tears during the experience, including when he was excavated. Upon seeing sunlight shine through the transparent casket, Donaldson can be see wiping tears from his eyes, saying: \"I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.\"<\/p><p>In accomplishing the challenge, Donaldson smashed the previous world record for being buried alive, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9bqk6ZUsKyA\" target=\"_blank\">50 hours<\/a>. <\/p><p>Donaldson has amassed an incredible amount of money, with estimates ranging between $3 million and $5 million per month from ad revenue alone. The crux of Donaldson's videos is that he carries out bizarre and ridiculously expensive challenges that almost always go viral.<\/p><p>But he is not known only for these wacky stunts. He is also known for his acts of philanthropy, which have included gifting people cars, helping the deaf hear, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/cancel-culture-mrbeast-africa-wells\" target=\"_blank\">building water wells<\/a> for people in Africa. <\/p><p>This last act has motivated some to refer to Donaldson as a \"white male figure\" and charge him with monetizing acts of kindness, never minding the fact that he is actually helping people who find themselves in tough spots. <\/p><p>Donaldson's effort in building the wells in Africa is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beastphilanthropy.org\/campaign\/mrbeast-100-wells\" target=\"_blank\">expected to help<\/a> \"300-500K+ people across Cameroon, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe over their lifetime.\"<\/p><p>Nevertheless, it appears these acts of kindness are not good enough for the foot soldiers of cancel culture, who have condemned his actions because he happens to be white and records the whole endeavor.<\/p><p>\u201cI already know I\u2019m gonna get canceled because I uploaded a video helping people, and to be 100% clear, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Donaldson posted to X. <\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1720840900283163032\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\"><\/div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MrBeast\/status\/1720840900283163032\"><\/a>\n    <\/blockquote>\n        <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\"><\/script><p>\u201cI\u2019m always going to use my channel to help people and try to inspire my audience to do the same.\u201d<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

Shoppers across the nation are poised to take advantage of incredible deals. But be advised: Cybercriminals are also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enigmasoftware.com\/cyber-attacks-black-friday-historical-overview-safety-measures\/\" target=\"_blank\">marking these dates<\/a>, using the increase in online shopping to unleash phishing attacks, ransomware, and adware upon unsuspecting consumers.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThis time of year, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the National Security Agency step up their game to guard against major attacks. But the real onus of vigilance falls on consumers themselves to protect their digital sleighs from these modern-day Grinches.\n<\/p><h2>The top threats this holiday season<\/h2><p>\n\t<strong>Phishing scams: <\/strong>These scams take on a festive guise during the holiday season, with emails and messages crafted to mimic genuine holiday specials or charity drives, aiming to trick shoppers into giving away sensitive data or downloading malicious software.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Ransomware:<\/strong> Perhaps the best known version of malware, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rivitmedia.com\/topics\/cyberthreats\/ransomware\/\" target=\"_blank\">ransomware<\/a> demands payment to unlock access to the victim\u2019s data and often comes cloaked in holiday-themed downloads, exploiting the season's goodwill and the lure of holiday bargains.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Adware and browser hijacking:<\/strong> Malicious adware and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itfunk.org\/topics\/cyber-threats\/browser-hijackers\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">browser hijacking software<\/a> programs can redirect you to counterfeit websites boasting irresistible deals, only to rob you of your credit card details and personal information.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Fraudulent password requests:<\/strong> A common ruse involves emails falsely claiming to be from service providers, prompting users to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cyclonis.com\/remove-password-change-request-email-scam\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">change their passwords<\/a> with a link to a bogus website designed to steal information. Should you find yourself victimized, immediately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spywareremove.com\/resetting-apple-id-password-stepbystep-guide.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">changing your login credentials<\/a> is the best move.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Social media dangers:<\/strong> Particularly at risk are social media enthusiasts, with new <a href=\"https:\/\/torontosun.com\/opinion\/columnists\/rivera-how-big-tech-enables-cybercriminals-via-malvertising\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">malvertising<\/a> campaigns like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enigmasoftware.com\/nodestealermalware-removal\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NodeStealer<\/a>, which recently launched approximately 140 ad campaigns with images of attractive individuals, pushing malicious downloads onto devices.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAs the CISA and the NSA continue to monitor these threats and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisa.gov\/news-events\/cybersecurity-advisories\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">offer guidance<\/a>, they become an invaluable resource during the holiday season. Their efforts, combined with consumer awareness, are key to a safe digital shopping experience.\n<\/p><h2>12 ways to boost your online security as you shop<\/h2><p>\n\t<strong>Be alert with emails and deals:<\/strong> Carefully inspect promotional emails and online offers. Be on the lookout for phishing red flags, such as poor grammar, suspicious links, and unusual requests for personal information.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Choose secure payment options: <\/strong>Select payment methods that offer strong consumer protections, such as virtual credit cards or established online payment services.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Update your devices: <\/strong>Make sure your devices have the latest security updates installed to fend off threats.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Craft strong passwords: <\/strong>Generate unique, complex passwords for all online accounts and update them periodically. A password manager can be a valuable tool in managing your passwords effectively.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Use two-factor authentication:<\/strong> Add an extra layer of protection to your accounts by enabling two-factor authentication, which might require an additional step or two, but an extra minute of inconvenience is a fine trade-off for the hours or days you\u2019ll spend cleaning up the mess if your accounts are hacked.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Watch your transactions:<\/strong> Keep a close eye on your bank and credit card statements, watching for any unauthorized activity.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Use caution on public Wi-Fi: <\/strong>Avoid performing transactions over public Wi-Fi. If you must, use a virtual private network to secure your connection.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Keep informed on cybersecurity:<\/strong> Stay updated on the latest cybersecurity threats by following trusted <a href=\"https:\/\/cybersecurityventures.com\/cybersecurity-associations\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">organizations<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.goenvy.io\/the-top-30-cyber-security-experts-you-need-to-follow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">experts<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Steer clear of suspicious links:<\/strong> Do not click on links from unknown sources, as they could lead to harmful sites or malware downloads.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Verify website authenticity:<\/strong> Only shop on known, legitimate websites, and verify that their URLs start with HTTPS to ensure a secure connection.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Question too-good-to-be-true offers:<\/strong> Be wary of offers that seem too incredible, as they often are and may be phishing attempts or scams. This is especially true on social media.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Back up your data:<\/strong> Regularly back up your important data to recover quickly in the event of a cyberattack.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIntegrating these 12 tips into your holiday shopping habits can help you enjoy the season's cheer without compromising your online safety. Cybersecurity is a year-round commitment, so consider it the gift that keeps on giving.\n<\/p>",

While the area was still overrun by invaders, a farmer worked feverishly to keep those numbers from climbing.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOz Davidian of Maslul made roughly 20 trips between the beleaguered kibbutz and his farming village, rescuing revelers who survived the initial massacre.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe Times of Israel \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/truck-dashcam-footage-shows-farmer-dodging-bullets-as-he-saved-120-from-music-festival\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> that while each trip was roughly 10 miles, Davidian needed to chart a new route every time on account of the roving terrorists. After all, Israeli security forces, unaware of the music festival prior to the invasion, would not regain control of the area and Route 232 until later in the day.\n<\/p><p>\n\tDashcam footage shows Davidian driving around burned-out cars and through clouds of smoke.

They reportedly returned to the scene of the massacre together, finding \"hundreds of corpses all over the place, on the road and in the fields,\" along with \"loads of cars \u2013 some burnt out, some with their lights blinking, and corpses with shotgun wounds inside cars.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tOn one of his trips toward the source of the black smoke on the horizon, Davidian encountered a group of men he initially figured for paramedics and soldiers.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"I asked one of them what was happening, and before he answered me, I realized that they might be terrorists. I addressed him in Arabic, and asked 'Are they dead, are there injured,' and he answered, and then suddenly, I understood he was a terrorist and he understood that I was a Jew,\" said Davidian.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe farmer indicated he floored the gas pedal as the terrorists opened fire, but \"by some miracle, none of [the bullets] hit the car.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"They were spraying everywhere with bullets. You can't get your head around that level of evil,\" said Davidian. \"They shot at everything that moved.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tAccording to the farmer, Hamas terrorists weren't just murdering. \"They were raping,\" said Davidian. \"One was raping, another was shooting, protecting the former, watching him rape.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tDespite the carnage and confusion, Davidian and the reserve officer ultimately managed to track down plenty of survivors. They made sure to both record the names of the concert-goers they picked up and to give them an opportunity to call loved ones to notify them they were all right.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"When you see hundreds of young people, dead and wounded and fleeing into the fields, and terrorists shooting in every direction, you put everything to one side, the fear, the family, and you go to get them out,\" concluded Davidian.\n<\/p><p>\n\tHis daughter Oriah said of her father, \"He has always been my hero.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhile initial reports put the death toll at the Supernova festival at around 260, the Times of Israel indicated investigators have since determined over 360 of the roughly 4,000 revelers were murdered on Oct. 7.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<em>Like Blaze News?

She went on to compare the nation of Israel to Nazi Germany. <\/p><p style=\"\">Hamas murdered 1,200 Jews and abducted 240 more on October 7, which prompted Israel to declare war. The Jewish state launched ground operations in Gaza following the attack, including targeting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/patients-and-staff-evacuate-shifa-hospital-as-israel-carries-out-airstrike-in-southern-gaza\" target=\"_blank\">Shifa Hospital<\/a> and the tunnels beneath it, believed to be the location of Hamas' headquarters.<\/p><p style=\"\">Chaudry reportedly posted to Facebook on October 26, writing: \"I will never be able to understand how the world summoned up rage for 40 fake Israeli babies while completely turning a blind eye to 3,000 real Palestinian babies.\"<\/p><p style=\"\">Claims from the Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, about the number of dead Palestinians in the conflict have been completely unverified and are widely suspected of being inflated. <\/p><p style=\"\">On October 17, Chaudry posted two images of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin \u2014 one from 1936 featuring the Nazi flag, then another illuminated with the Israeli flag following Hamas' attack, with the caption: \"The moment when you become what you hated most.\" <\/p><p style=\"\">Though Chaudry has posted several other anti-Israel posts in the time since Hamas' attack, she has maintained her position on the Maryland Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention. She was reportedly put in that post by Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/maryland-hate-crime-task-force-member-claimed-babies-murdered-hamas-fake-compared-israel-nazis\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News Digital<\/a> was told by Jennifer Donelan, Brown's spokesperson, that \u201cthe views and opinions of any individual Commission member do not reflect those of either the <em>Maryland Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention<\/em> or the Attorney General.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cWe understand that there are many viewpoints regarding current events in the Middle East.

And what happened on the seventh of October? Murder. Slaughter of innocent people in their homes or at a music festival. That's genocidal intentions.\"<\/p><p>Kirby then reaffirmed the U.S. stance that Israel should try to limit civilian casualties. But he made it clear the only party guilty of genocidal intentions is Israel's enemy. <\/p><p>\"Israel is not trying to wipe the Palestinian people off the map.

The American workforce used to be synonymous with American greatness.<br\/><\/p><p>But our workforce was devasted in 2020, when even the casual observer came to understand that the federal government couldn\u2019t pay people to stay idle and out of work forever. <\/p><p>So why are Democrats in Congress so eager to repeat the one of the most glaring pandemic-era policy blunders?<\/p><p>With a breathtaking disregard for lessons learned, Senators John Fetterman (D-Penn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and others <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finance.senate.gov\/chairmans-news\/wyden-bennet-beyer-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-overhaul-unemployment-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">are seeking<\/a> to expand state-run unemployment insurance programs, transitioning them into something more closely resembling a federally mandated universal basic income scheme than an emergency safety net program.<\/p><p>Their new plan would replace up to 100% of workers\u2019 wages for more than a year. That\u2019s not insurance \u2014 that\u2019s a new entitlement paid for by the employers taxed to fund the program.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/US\/bill\/SB3140\/2023\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Bill 3140<\/a>, the Unemployment Insurance Modernization and Recession Readiness Act, could be forgiven as merely na\u00efve if it hadn\u2019t arrived so soon after pandemic policies cost taxpayers billions of dollars and encouraged millions of able-bodied Americans to exit the workforce even as employers struggled to find workers.<\/p><p>With the COVID experience so recent, the senators\u2019 plan is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the moral and economic dignity afforded by a job. It represents a final neutralizing of the once-great American work ethic and, with it, the civic virtues of independence, individual responsibility, and self-government.<\/p><p>It\u2019s clear that big-government types like Sanders and Warren find work antithetical to their aims of cradle-to-grave dependency. They\u2019ve been trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2020\/02\/bernie-sanders-wins-new-hampshire\/606022\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mainstream socialism<\/a> for decades. Now they\u2019ve turned their sights on the worker safety net program as a vehicle to destroy work itself.<\/p><p>Unemployment insurance has always been about providing limited, temporary assistance to workers who lose a job through no fault of their own. Funded by employer taxes, the largely state-run program has served as a rapid on-ramp to the workforce, ensuring the unemployed have some immediate support as they look for their next job.<\/p><p>The arrangement has worked well, allowing states to devise innovations that result in higher rates of re-employment, shorter periods of unemployment, and lower taxes on employers. But all of that would change under this new proposal.<\/p><p>In place of state innovation would come federal standardization \u2014 and not in a good way, either.<\/p><p>In 2020, Democrats pushed successfully for an expansion of unemployment benefits as part of federal pandemic relief spending. Stopping just short of a federal takeover of the unemployment program, Congress increased weekly benefit levels <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.dol.gov\/2021\/01\/11\/unemployment-benefits-answering-common-questions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">up to $600 per week<\/a> above existing limits, expanded benefits to individuals whose employers (if they had one) did not pay into the program, and paid benefits for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pandemicoversight.gov\/news\/articles\/how-much-money-did-pandemic-unemployment-programs-pay-out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than a year and a half<\/a>.<\/p><p>The results were disastrous.<\/p><p>Billions of additional dollars flooding the system became a magnet for fraudsters. The Department of Labor\u2019s inspector general <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oig.dol.gov\/public\/reports\/oa\/2023\/19-23-014-03-315.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">estimates at least $35 billion<\/a> in unemployment benefits was lost to fraud. State programs took a hit as well, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/agencies\/eta\/unemployment-insurance-payment-accuracy\/data\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">losing more than $12 billion<\/a> to fraudulent and ineligible claims.<\/p><p>Perhaps worst of all, the fact that an unemployment claimant could replace most \u2014 if not all \u2014 of his income by remaining unemployed slowed the pace of the post-pandemic recovery. While tens of millions of hardworking Americans returned to work as quickly as possible, millions of others stayed on unemployment. It wasn\u2019t until a year after the federal benefit expansion ended that U.S. employment <a href=\"https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CLF16OV\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">returned to its pre-pandemic level<\/a>.<\/p><p>So what do Democrats want to do now? Their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finance.senate.gov\/imo\/media\/doc\/ui_modernization_and_recession_readiness_act_-_section-by-section_summary.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new bill<\/a> would force states to pay unemployment claims for up to six months and make an additional federally funded year of benefits available after that. Those benefits would be expensive, replacing 75% of a worker\u2019s salary <em>at minimum<\/em>. But under certain circumstances, a worker could receive up to 100% of his former wages.<\/p><p>And, naturally, labor unions and nongovernmental organizations are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finance.senate.gov\/imo\/media\/doc\/support_letter_for_the_unemployment_insurance_modernization_and_recession_readiness_act_101023.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thrilled at the prospect<\/a> of compelling employers to pay striking workers \u2014 an idea so ludicrous that even California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/story\/2023-09-30\/california-gov-newsom-bill-striking-workers-unemployment-benefits\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a similar proposal<\/a> in the Golden State.<\/p><p>Substituting government dependency for the dignity and upward mobility work provides is not a formula for American prosperity and success. For American greatness to endure, let\u2019s hope Congress never takes this plan seriously. <\/p>",

Chief of Information Technology Robert Beltran stated that the upgrade will allow the department to encrypt its radio channels by the end of 2024.<\/p><p>The project is raising concerns about transparency, press freedom, and law enforcement accountability.<\/p><p>Supporters of the system encryption upgrade argue that it is necessary to protect law enforcement officers and the personal details of crime victims. <\/p><p>Beltran stated, \"The department provides information to reporters many times a day every day. We also have hundreds of digital media officers assigned to precincts that are also updating information on social media in real time.\"<\/p><p>He added that the NYPD would not consider providing exemptions to news outlets or journalists to be able to listen in on the communications. The department is weighing the option of providing the public with delayed access to the feed, which, if approved, would not be implemented until after the network is already fully encrypted.<\/p><p>Some New York City politicians are pushing back against the planned upgrade. During a Monday City Council Public Safety Committee oversight hearing, NYC Democratic Councilman Robert Holden said, \"We are the media capital of the world. If we just cut off the media to any interest encryption, completely, it would be really counterproductive.\"<\/p><p>Todd Maisel, journalist and founder of the NY Media Consortium, argued during the hearing, \"It's not about radio transmissions; it's whether you trust the NYPD narrative. Do you trust the police to be 100% transparent with the most regressive transparency policy in the history of New York City?\"<\/p><p>Committee Chair Kamillah Hanks called for \"more clarity\" on the impact that blocking the radio communications would have on media outlets.<\/p><p>\"I'm sure there will be transparency and reporting bills introduced after rollout,\" Hanks said.<\/p><p>The blocked transmissions will also impact the popular Citizen App, which relies on the police scanner to provide residents with real-time information about in-progress incidents in their area.<\/p><p>The app's CEO, Andrew Frame, told the Post, \"We have spent six years building up this network and saving a tremendous amount of lives, and this threatens all of this progress.\"<\/p><p>Frame called the move toward encrypted communication \"a dangerous step backward.\"<\/p><p>Last December, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) came under fire for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/censorship-in-its-purest-form-chicago-news-outlets-slam-mayor-lightfoot-for-blocking-live-police-scanner-transmissions\" target=\"_self\">moving to block live transmissions<\/a> of police scanner communications.

The idea that the White House could use the threat of freezing relief as leverage against Iran \u2014 to say nothing of imposing new sanctions \u2014 appears not to have crossed anyone\u2019s mind.\n<\/p><p>\n\tSo billions of dollars \u2014 including an estimated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=22GBXj9P61U\" target=\"_blank\">$100 billion<\/a> in unfrozen assets so far \u2014 will keep rolling into the mullahs\u2019 bank accounts for at least as long as Joe Biden sits in the Oval Office.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAs if we did not have enough reasons to reimpose sanctions before October 7, confirmation that Iran masterminded, trained, and funded the Hamas atrocities in Israel should have been enough to ensure that we turned off the money spigot.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt\u2019s a safe bet that a $6 billion payout the Biden administration claimed to have halted probably helped underwrite Hamas\u2019 attacks. But Congress will need to get to the bottom of it. That $6 billion, by the way, was for American hostages held in Iran, not Americans held in Gaza. We\u2019ve come a long way down in the more than 40 years since Tehran first dared to hold American citizens in captivity.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">It\u2019s almost as if Iran is a force of nature rather than a country susceptible to rewards and punishments like any other.\n<\/p><p>\n\tState Department spokesman Matthew Miller last week attempted to defend the latest sanctions waiver with the empty promise that the funds can only be used for \u201chumanitarian purposes.\u201d Even if there were a way to closely monitor the use of these funds, money is fungible. Adding billions to one category of the ledger simply frees up billions in another.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMiller, in an effort to excuse what is sure to be continued aggressive behavior from Iran, also claimed that Iran would continue \u201cdestabilizing activities\u201d <em>regardless<\/em> of the waiver. Apparently, the State Department will not consider the possibility that sanctions with teeth could dissuade Iran from carrying out its misdeeds in the Middle East and throughout the world. It\u2019s almost as if Iran is a force of nature rather than a country susceptible to rewards and punishments like any other.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAll of this is happening in the midst of escalating Iranian attacks on U.S. troops through Iran's proxy militias in the Middle East. There have been 55 confirmed attacks on U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Syria since last Monday, including four strikes on one U.S. encampment in Syria alone. But you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find any coverage of this in the mainstream media. While we\u2019ve witnessed the occasional skirmish over the years, the number of attacks since early October is unprecedented and a clear message.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOur response? More money.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWith dozens of injured U.S. military personnel, Iran is showing no signs of stopping. We seem more concerned with not ruffling the mullahs\u2019 feathers than with making sure they know who runs the show. Well, as a wise man once said, <em>either you run the show or the show runs you<\/em>.\n<\/p><p>\n In effect, the Biden administration is paying Iran to test our limits. In the process, we aren\u2019t just funding terrorism and war \u2014 we are rewarding it.<\/p>",

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/where-have-you-gone-president-washington.jpg?id=50528539&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C222\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\tIt wasn\u2019t uncommon to hear the music of Simon and Garfunkel filling the rooms and hallways of my childhood home, and it would be folly to belittle Paul Simon\u2019s prowess as a songwriter. Still, aside from our shared Jewish heritage and affinity for the New York Yankees, Simon and I likely share very little in common, particularly in the realm of politics.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhen Simon first began writing his most famous song, \u201cMrs. Robinson\u201d had the working title \u201cMrs. Roosevelt.\u201d Simon changed the name for Dustin Hoffman\u2019s breakout film, \u201cThe Graduate.\u201d You\u2019d certainly never find me writing an ode to Eleanor Roosevelt.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnd yet, in recent days, a single line from the song has been stuck in my mind. \u201cWhere have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.\u201d Simon once explained that the line was a longing for American heroes at a time when such heroes seemed to be in short supply.\n<\/p><p>\n\tNo offense to Joltin\u2019 Joe, but the line going through my head today would begin, \u201cWhere have you gone, President Washington?\u201d Forgiving the obvious change in syllables, as I don\u2019t claim to be a songwriter or a poet, both America and the Jewish community need the country's greatest general now more than ever.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOn August 18, 1790, then-President Washington penned a <a href=\"https:\/\/founders.archives.gov\/documents\/Washington\/05-06-02-0135\" target=\"_blank\">letter<\/a> to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island. For the first time since the Romans expelled the Jewish people from Israel, a head of state recognized the full and equal rights of Jews in America with \u201cliberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhile many Jews stop there in celebration of such a recognition, it is the next line of Washington\u2019s letter that matters even more: \u201cIt is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tFor centuries, as Jews moved from nation to nation, by choice or more often by force, we sought to participate as citizens without forgoing our Jewish identity. In the few instances we were not enslaved by these regimes and our basic rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness weren\u2019t violated, Jews were at best tolerated, temporarily, until some kind of social or political problem required scapegoats and we once again became targets of blame, bloodshed, and banishment.\n<\/p><p>\n\tBut Washington\u2019s words offered a wholly new paradigm. He reminded Jews, in writing, that recognition of our own \u201cinherent natural rights\u201d \u2014 naturally granted by our shared Creator and equal to all other human beings \u2014 is not some indulgence or toleration by a higher class of elites.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhen Washington welcomed Jewish people as fellow citizens who wanted to live freely and enjoy the \u201cliberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship,\u201d Jews in America believed we had finally found a safe home.\n<\/p><p>\n\tBut in the weeks since the October 7 Hamas massacre in Israel, Jews have become significantly less safe in America. What changed?\n<\/p><p>\n\tA century-long progressive makeover of this country has set us on a path of multicultural toleration. These regressive cultural shifts, mislabeled \u201cprogress,\u201d have moved many Americans away from the principles of individual natural rights that underscored Washington\u2019s letter back to the old, tribal way of merely <em>tolerating<\/em> Jews when it\u2019s convenient and targeting and blaming them when it\u2019s not.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOur schools and universities, which have become bastions of progressive multiculturalism, emphasize the idea of toleration as a societal good from a young age. Even those citizens who claim to reject progressivism defend their own goodness by claiming tolerance of other\u2019s beliefs.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWashington\u2019s words were instead rooted in the very foundation of our country: the idea that we are all equal as human beings, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n<\/p><p>\n\tToday, as nihilist mobs chase Jews into libraries in New York and kill our elderly in the streets of Los Angeles, as Jews are merely tolerated by some and outright denounced by others, the cause can be attributed directly to America\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d evolution. These ideas have shifted the emphasis in our relationships to our differences and inequalities instead of what makes us alike and equal. It\u2019s time to abandon these notions.\n<\/p><p>\n\tToday, 233 years later, I\u2019m no longer sure America is safe. Like Paul Simon in the 1960s, I long for a hero like Washington who can reorient America toward its founding principles.\n<\/p><p>\n\tToday, I look for neighbors who embrace Washington\u2019s closing prayer to the Newport Jews: \u201cMay the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\u201d\n<\/p>",

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/bruce-willis-dementia-and-my-father.jpg?id=50527758&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C43%2C0%2C106\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\tThe first time my father met my son, he laughed. We had the boy, then 8 months old, strapped into one of those elastic baby jumpers you suspend from a doorframe. Up and down he went as Dad, whom everyone called \u201cTip,\u201d took in the sight of his third grandkid and first male heir. Then he said something I still think about almost a decade later, although it\u2019s as much the strange mix of resignation and wonder in his voice as the words themselves that stick in the mind.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cOh, no,\u201d he chuckled softly. \u201cIt\u2019s happening again.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tThat was the last time my father visited us in Los Angeles. He was just shy of 70, and the Alzheimer\u2019s was beginning to make the trip from Pennsylvania unmanageable, even with my younger sister to guide him through the now alien and confusing rituals of air travel.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMy son, of course, didn\u2019t remember that encounter, although one a few years later left an impression. We had stopped for a quick meet-up in Baltimore on our way to visit my mother in Hilton Head. At lunch, Tip picked up one of the small, brown plastic toy soldiers my son had scattered across the table and tried to eat it. He didn\u2019t mean it a joke (they must have looked like chocolates), but his deadpan affect made it funny. He no longer talked at that point, and his movements were slow and exaggerated, giving the incident a kind of Buster Keaton quality.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMy father\u2019s condition worsened considerably before he died 18 months later, although he was responsive and aware until the final week or so. I\u2019d learned that no matter how much of his memory and identity the disease continued to strip away, it was still always possible to reach each other. Tip was still \u201cthere,\u201d if not on terms anyone would have chosen, and it was up to us to relax in his presence and find him. This was a lesson my stepmother, sister, and her husband \u2014 who lived with and cared for Tip at home until the end \u2014 learned quickly.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt took me, with my cynical ideas about \u201cquality of life\u201d and my proud disdain of sentimentality, a bit longer.\n<\/p><h2>Subtle but apparent signs<\/h2><p>\n\tI thought of Tip when I saw a video of Bruce Willis celebrating his birthday in March. His ex-wife <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/justdemi\/status\/1637617142655774721\" target=\"_blank\">Demi Moore shot it and posted it<\/a> on her Instagram. A spirited rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d fills the spacious, light-filled kitchen as the camera pans across the dozen or so revelers \u2014 Willis\u2019 young daughters from his recent second marriage, his and Moore\u2019s now adult daughters and their families \u2014 until landing on the guest of honor himself. He mugs for the camera as he finishes the song with a mock-operatic flourish, then blows out the candles on the pie his wife, Emma, puts in front of him.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t just show up at someone\u2019s house and ask them to talk about their emotions!\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tLike everyone else, I had followed Willis\u2019 sudden retirement from acting in March 2022. The initial reason given was aphasia, a condition that I found frustratingly vague. Trouble with words? Did that mean he could come back later after making adjustments, or maybe shift gears and take up blues harmonica again (the return of the \u201cReturn of Bruno\u201d)? Even when the far more terminal-sounding diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia was announced, I couldn\u2019t quite accept its <em>finality<\/em>. I realized this when I watched the birthday video and found myself scanning it for signs of Willis\u2019 decline. They were subtle but amply apparent: the slight stiffness of movement, a missing tooth, the faintly childlike way he seemed to follow the lead of his loved ones, and the tender, quiet gestures with which they led him.\n<\/p><p>\n\tI had confirmed the worst, and I offered Willis and his family my prayers. But I also noticed real joy there, both in Willis\u2019 exuberance and in everyone\u2019s unselfconscious, enthusiastic efforts to encourage it. Willis was having fun, but with a clearly stunted capacity to acknowledge or reciprocate his family\u2019s love. They showered him with it anyway.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThen again, how much of this capacity do any of us possess even in full health?\n<\/p><h2>An emotional distance <\/h2><p>\n\tI\u2019ve already indicated the emotional limits I had to overcome in those last visits with my father; let\u2019s just say a certain reluctance to \u201copen up\u201d is part of my heritage. The oldest of three, Tip was a small-town high school football captain who got into Yale just before it turned coed. Marriage, a stint driving a tank in Vietnam, three children (starting with yours truly), and law school followed.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTip avoided the more fashionable excesses of some of his peers in favor of good, old-fashioned carousing, which he pursued with vigor and dedication. After my mother divorced him and moved us 90 miles up U.S. 22 to her hometown, he subsequently found himself on the verge of ruining his second marriage. He sobered up and threw himself into his work with single-minded focus.\n<\/p><p>\n\tA new lease on life renewed his sense of responsibility for his younger siblings, who, like Tip, no longer had living parents to guide them. He tended to lecture my uncle Andy, two years younger and a bit of a slacker <em>avant la lettre<\/em>, with paternal authority. Tip\u2019s wife gave birth to a girl and then a boy, and once again sharing a house with young children made him more sympathetic to the endless, \u201970s-inflected seeking of his younger sister, Molly, the baby of the family.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMolly was always welcome in his big, bustling house, and he was happy to listen to her detail her progress with whatever new healing modality she had found. But he balked when she demanded more of him than mere familial duty and affection. In the middle of one particularly insistent request that he join her in more rarefied realms of feeling, he finally snapped: \u201cYou can\u2019t just show up at someone\u2019s house and ask them to talk about their emotions!\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tMolly was regularly by Tip\u2019s side during those final years, and her comfort with more intuitive forms of communication meant she was a natural caretaker. (During COVID, she pivoted to doing her in-person healings over Zoom.) One spring, she told me, she and Tip were walking in the back yard when he was moved to try to say something.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cWhat is it, Tip?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs it the flowers?\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s you \u2026 it\u2019s me \u2026 it\u2019s everything,\u201d he managed. Was he finally receptive to oneness with mother Gaia? Even in Molly\u2019s telling, he still had the final word. When she happily informed her brother that he had just had his first \u201cspiritual experience,\u201d he summed up his skepticism with a perfectly timed verbal shrug: \u201cMeh.\u201d\n<\/p><h2>Roles of a lifetime<\/h2><p>\n\tIt\u2019s fair to say I \u201cgrew up\u201d with Bruce Willis; I was 13 when \u201cMoonlighting\u201d premiered, and in David Addison I saw a class clown made good. Finally, a version of being \u201ccool\u201d to which my awkward, comedy-obsessed friends and I could aspire. Then came Willis\u2019 unlikely pivot to action hero with the genre-defining \u201cDie Hard,\u201d in which the wisecracks were just as important as the explosions.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThat was the summer before my senior year of high school, and I\u2019d started to fantasize about the destiny awaiting me. Like Willis, I was unique, but would the world recognize this in me as it did in him? By the time I graduated college, his outsized celebrity \u2014 the wild parties, the public spat with Cybill Shepherd, the vanity investment in Planet Hollywood, the marriage to \u201cIt Girl\u201d Moore \u2014 had started to add a note of self-parody to the world-weary everymen he often played on-screen.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\tWho better to represent the increasing irrelevance of the theatrical first-run movie than its humbled onetime king?\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe night before I left to teach English at a natural gas distribution company in Czechoslovakia, my friends sent me off with one last trip to the local multiplex to see the execrable, thoroughly entertaining \u201cStriking Distance.\u201d Bruce as a highly decorated Pittsburgh police detective busted down to river patrol? An alcoholic who lives on a houseboat stalked by a serial killer? Tagline: \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want him to make waves, they never should\u2019ve put him in the water\u201d? <em>Peak Willis<\/em>.\n<\/p><p>\n\tFor the rest of the \u201990s, I enjoyed his movies as ironic monuments to Hollywood hubris; even his excellent work in \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d like his cameo as himself in \u201cThe Player,\u201d seemed like meta-commentary on one of the industry\u2019s most profitable and enduring brands.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe new millennium brought more unsatisfying \u201cDie Hard\u201d cash-grabs, M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s boring deconstructed superhero movies, and \u2014 poignantly, in retrospect \u2014 phoned-in performances in dozens of generic, straight-to-streaming \u201cthrillers.\u201d I lost interest. Who better to represent the increasing irrelevance of the theatrical first-run movie than its humbled onetime king?\n<\/p><p>\n\tThere does seem to be something filial in my progression as a Willis fan. The initial idolization, followed by rivalry, then benign indifference. In fact, I\u2019ve always been able to see a bit of Tip when I look at Willis. The fleshy, German features, the stocky athlete\u2019s build, the swagger of a natural-born life of the party, and, more recently, the proud embrace of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paradigmclinic.co.uk\/the-norwood-scale\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Norwood 7<\/a>.\n<\/p><h2>The blessing of confinement to the present<\/h2><p>\n\tThis is why Willis\u2019 latest role has me transfixed all over again. FTD and Alzheimer\u2019s are different diseases, but not so different that I can\u2019t imagine a bit of what his family is going through. That includes their decision to share their beloved husband and father\u2019s suffering on social media.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\tThe dramatic deathbed scene of reconciliation and revelation, where everything long unsaid and unfelt finds its proper and final expression, was not to be.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn the pre-digital age, Willis would most likely have withdrawn completely from public view, leaving us to piece together his fate via sensational tabloid headlines and blurry telephoto images. But the internet, for better or for worse, has made our relationship with celebrities more intimate. Much of this is fake, of course, but even those of us on the D-list have a hint of the parasocial in our relationships. How many of our purportedly \u201cpersonal\u201d texts and direct messages, after all, could just as easily be addressed to our amorphous collective of \u201cfollowers\u201d?\n<\/p><p>\n\tNovelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch spent the last two years of her life with Alzheimer\u2019s. In his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/1998\/07\/27\/elegy-for-iris\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thoughtful account of her decline<\/a>, her husband, John Bayley, noted that he could still reach her with humor, even as language and memory became less reliable: \u201cOnly a joke survives \u2014 the last thing to find its way into consciousness when the brain is atrophied.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhat also seems to survive is a BS detector:\n<\/p><blockquote>\n\t<em>She loves to be teased, but when I make the tease a tender one by adding, \u201cI love listening to you,\u201d her face clouds over. She can always tell the difference between the irresponsibility of a joke or a straight tease and the note of \u201ccaring\u201d or of \u201cloving<\/em><em> care\u201d \u2014 which, however earnest and true, always sounds inauthentic.<\/em><em><\/em>\n<\/blockquote><p>\n\tNo more stilted, obligatory declarations of feeling: That\u2019s one blessing of this disease I can get behind. I pray that Willis\u2019 loved ones feel similarly blessed.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<em>To dust we all return<\/em>. The terrible thing about dementia is how eagerly it commences this pitiless disintegration even before death. But this drawn-out dying also tends to confine us to the present, stripping away the relentless obsession with our future and past. Willis no longer has a reputation to manage or a career to plan. In his better moments, he is simply a man delighting in and dependent on those closest to him.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIs it na\u00efve to think that this reflects something of the \u201creal\u201d Bruce Willis, a soul sustained at every moment by a continuous outpouring of grace? Isn\u2019t this what remains of each of us at the end? It\u2019s generous of Willis\u2019 family to offer this final glimpse behind the scenes as we prepare to say goodbye.\n<\/p><p>\n\tI could have said a better goodbye to my father. He was private about his condition at first, and he was on the other side of the country. For my part, I was busy with my own family and distracted by the typical midlife anxieties. The dramatic deathbed scene of reconciliation and revelation, where everything long unsaid and unfelt finds its proper and final expression, was not to be.\n<\/p><p>\n\tBut as much as I wish my dad were still around, and as much as I would have liked for him to meet his grandson while still fully aware, I really can\u2019t complain. When it comes to parenthood\u2019s mysterious admixture of joy, heartbreak, and tedium and the miraculous way a bit of us survives in each subsequent generation, \u201cOh no, it\u2019s happening again\u201d says it all.\n<\/p>",

They are accused of participating in a \"seemingly coordinated\" media campaign to report that Truth Social had lost $73 million.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"This number was an utter fabrication,\" the lawsuit read.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe company goes on to claim that it demanded a correction and retraction from the media outlets but that none of them complied completely or apologized. The lawsuit says that the false reports damaged the company's ability to raise funds for a planned company merger.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"Existing investors and potential investors alike were concerned by the false stories,\" the lawsuit read.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe lawsuit says that the figure cited by the news outlets does not appear in its SEC filing, which was readily available to any outlet.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe lawsuit asks for $1.5 billion from the defendants and also for attorneys' fees.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAlso on Monday, tech billionaire Elon Musk filed what he called a \"thermonuclear\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/media-matters-musk-paxton-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">defamation lawsuit <\/a>against Media Matters, the left-wing activist organization. The liberal group pressured companies successfully to drop their ads on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, based on a report claiming their ads would show up next to white supremacist posts.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMusk denied the report and accused Media Matters of falsifying data in order to damage his company.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"The discovery and depositions will be glorious to behold,\" he said. <br\/>\n<\/p><h2>Here's one of the reports denied by Truth Social: <\/h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"c0e079fa0d072ec8de75425d2c9ab59a\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wNz7RV6ZSxk?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<\/p><p>\n\t<em>Like Blaze News?

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/dei-won-t-die-easy-at-texas-a-m-but-blaze-news-report-demonstrates-there-s-hope-yet.webp?id=50523270&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\tA recent Blaze News report \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/columns\/opinion\/texas-am-defies-diversity-bans\" target=\"_blank\">revealed<\/a> that an order from the Republican governor, a directive from the university system's chancellor, and the guarantee of a prohibitive law going into effect in January were not altogether enough to dissuade Texas A&M University from asking potential hires to signal their ideological conformity to and support of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The unwanted attention resulting from that same report appears to have had an impact, however, demonstrating the importance of vigilance and sustained pressure.\n<\/p><p>\n\tLast week, Dr. Scott Yenor, a political science professor at Boise State University, highlighted \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/columns\/opinion\/texas-am-defies-diversity-bans\" target=\"_blank\">various apparent examples<\/a> of departments hiring \"based on ideological conformity and racial preferences\" at Texas A&M.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhile many ostensibly DEI-coded postings remain, following Yenor's  report, one of the most brazen examples had been noticeably altered.\n<\/p><h2>What's the background?<\/h2><p>\n\tGov. Greg Abbott notified Texas public institutions in February to stop using DEI hiring practices.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"The innocuous sounding notion of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) has been manipulated to push policies that expressly favor some demographic groups to the detriment of others,\" said the memo, \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tpr.org\/podcast\/the-source\/2023-02-14\/governor-abbott-declares-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-policies-in-hiring-are-illegal\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly<\/a> penned by the governor's chief of staff, Gardner Pate.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWeeks later, the University of Texas System's Board of Regents indicated it had put a pause on all new DEI policies.\n<\/p><p>\n\tChairman Kevin Eltife, an Abbott appointee, \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/meganmmenchaca\/status\/1628490185821376516\" target=\"_blank\">suggested<\/a> that while the system seeks to promote diversity, \"certain DEI efforts have strayed from the original intent to now imposing requirements and actions that, rightfully so, has raised the concerns of our policymakers around those efforts on campuses across our entire state.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tOn March 2, Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp directed university leaders to stop asking job applicants about their commitment to DEI in their applications, \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.houstonpublicmedia.org\/articles\/news\/texas\/2023\/03\/03\/445266\/texas-am-university-system-bans-diversity-statements-from-job-applications\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> the Texas Tribune.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"No university or agency in the A&M System will admit any student, nor hire any employee based on any factor other than merit,\" wrote Sharp.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTexas lawmakers went a step farther to ensure there was no outstanding confusion concerning the Lone Star State's  prohibition on race- and identity-based hiring practices.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/capitol.texas.gov\/tlodocs\/88R\/billtext\/pdf\/SB00017F.pdf#navpanes=0\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Bill 17<\/a>, ratified by Gov. Greg Abbott and effective Jan. 1, 2024, prohibits Texas' public universities from establishing a diversity, equity, and inclusion office; using DEI criteria in their hiring practices; and requiring employees or prospective employees to attend DEI trainings.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe law further requires that governing boards ensure that each institutional unit does not, among other things, \"compel, require, induce, or solicit any person to provide a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement or give preferential consideration to any person based on the provision of a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tPublic higher-education institutions will be audited every four years to determine if taxpayer funder were squandered on DEI-related schemes. Offending institutions that fail to correct the issue inside 180 days can become inelgible for formula funding increases and institutional enhancements, \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.caller.com\/story\/news\/politics\/state\/2023\/11\/17\/ut-system-sets-rules-to-comply-with-new-texas-tenure-anti-dei-laws\/71608365007\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> the Austin American-Statesman.\n<\/p><p>\n\tEltife, an Abbott appointee, said last week, \"We really want to make something crystal clear, whether you like the policy or whether you like this law or any other law, the University of Texas System is going to respect the process, and we're going to respect the law.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"We're not going to look for loopholes. We're not going to look for workarounds. We're going to implement the law as passed,\" said Eltife.\n<\/p><h2>The DEI scheme that won't die\n<\/h2><p>\n\tDr. Yenor noted in his initial report that the Bush School of Government at Texas A&M was hiring four tenure-track assistant professors, asking candidates in a posting \u2014 \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231115165232\/https:\/faculty.tamu.edu\/JobDetail?JobId=126310\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20231115165232\/https:\/faculty.tamu.edu\/JobDetail?JobId=126310\">archived<\/a> on Nov. 15 \u2014 to provide a cover letter \"referencing research agenda, past or planned contributions to advancing diversity, and teaching interests.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe day after Yenor's report, the posting was changed such that it <a href=\"https:\/\/faculty.tamu.edu\/JobDetail?JobId=126310\" target=\"_blank\">now omits<\/a> the \"past or planned contributions to advancing diversity\" language.\n<\/p><p>\n\tBlaze News reached out to Texas A&M's political science department but did not hear back by deadline.\n<\/p><p>\n\tYenor told Blaze News that the sudden about-face reveals that \"there was a recognition that the job posting explicitly violated Gov. Abbott's order abolishing DEI statements in use for faculty hiring or university hiring or state hiring. It was a direct affront to Gov. Abbot's executive order.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe change \"brought them into compliance with the executive order,\" at least in this instance, said Yenor.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnna Katherine Miller, education policy director at the Center for American Education, told Blaze News, \"Texas A&M's recent removal of diversity in their job posting after being called out for defying the governor's directive shows that policies banning DEI will not be easy to enforce on college campuses. Unwilling university presidents, aided and abetted by campus DEI bureaucracies, will do their best to evade these orders.\"\n<\/p><p>Yenor similarly suggested that prohibitions on DEI hiring practices \"are pretty easy to evade. Many of the universities have already suggested that they're going to do it. My initial article tried to show some of the ways in which they were evading it, but the Bush School advertisement didn't even try to evade it. It just violated it.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tYenor noted that one ostensible loophole is that rather than having applicants sign a DEI pledge, \"they're willing to make sure to evaluate that job application in light of the fact that they've done the work of diversity over the course of their lives.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"In other cases, the university says, 'This university stands for diversity and inclusion,' in one part of the ad, then it asks the potential job applicants whether or not they would like to respond to what the university stands for. That's another way of ... providing an opportunity to candidates to volunteer their adherence to the ideology,\" continued Yenor. \"I think the letter of the law may be complied with, but the spirit of the law is being violated in most of these jobs.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tSherry Sylvester, distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, told Blaze News that it's become clear since the passage of SB 17 that \"many in the university are committed to find workaround loopholes and ways to not comply. They have said this directly and indirectly. They've talked about the possibility of changing DEI to some other name.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tDespite a name change and possible facelift, Sylvester made clear what DEI amounts to: division and dehumanization\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"The problem with DEI is that it is divisive. Its worldview is that America's bad, Texas is bad, and the world is made up of either oppressors or the oppressed,\" said Sylvester. \"Your identity is based on immutable characteristics, gender and race, and not on your personal achievements; what you can do; what you've learned how to do; what you have overcome. We all don't start in the same place \u2014 nobody thinks that we do \u2014 but people achieve from wherever they start.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"[DEI] is anti-individual. ... That's one thing that's antithetical to our Texas identity. We believe every individual is unique, every individual finds their path, and our job is to make sure that there's nothing that stands in the way of any individual,\" continued Sylvester. \"DEI does not think in terms of the integrity of the individual. It thinks in terms of group identity, and people need to understand that.\"<\/p><h2>Seeing DEI off\n<\/h2><p>Extra to fostering an expectation among students and potential hires that they must be treated as individuals rather than on the basis of immutable characteristics and\/or group membership, Sylvester suggested that there are other ways to hold the university accountable.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"The legislation has several components for accountability. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board is one group that is available to monitor ... and report lack of compliance. The state auditor will also be monitoring the universities. Every university will have to come in and testify before the higher education committees in the [state] House and the Senate affirming that they are in compliance,\" said Sylvester.\n<\/p><p>\n\tHowever, even with such checks and balances, Sylvester underscored that good leadership remains a critical part of the solution.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"Texas public universities should make sure that all the leadership they hire are fully committed to ridding the academic institution of DEI,\" said Sylvester. \"No one should be hired for a leadership position in a Texas public university who supports DEI or has a wishy-washy position on DEI. Texans don't support DEI. The legislature has made it clear that we do not want DEI as part of the infrastructure in our institutions. So no leader should be hired unless they are fully committed to making sure that their academic institution is free of DEI.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tYenor emphasized that the \"only way to really halt the DEI revolution on campus is through university leadership that is willing to halt it and to put the money and prestige of the office of the university behind the non-DEI vision of education.\"<\/p><p>\n\tThe trouble, suggested the Boise professor, is that General Mark Welsh, Texas A&M's interim president, \"has signaled that he is interested in continuing the diversity, equity, inclusion revolution at Texas A&M, furthering it and deepening it. ... He's going to do whatever it takes, it looks like, to comply whatever letter of of the law is out there but to violate its spirit.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tGen. Welsh has long been a \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/texasscorecard.com\/state\/texas-ams-interim-president-historically-promotes-dei\/\" target=\"_blank\">supporter<\/a> of DEI, at least rhetorically. He recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/education\/2023\/09\/05\/texas-am-university-diversity-sb17\/\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> the Washington Post he would not have supported SB 17, stating, \"I don't believe it's beneficial to where we are trying to go long-range as a society.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tYenor indicated that the public has roughly 30 days to comment on whether Texas A&M's Board of Regents should officially appoint Welsh as university president, noting that \"I think this is one of the only chances that there will be to reverse some of these nefarious actions at Texas A&M.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t<em>Like Blaze News?

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/david-depape-and-the-glenn-beck-deflection.jpg?id=50523142&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C110%2C0%2C111\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\tDavid DePape, the deranged Bay Area man who broke into Nancy Pelosi\u2019s San Francisco mansion last year and fractured the skull of her husband, Paul, with a claw hammer, was found guilty Thursday of attempted kidnapping and assault \u201con account of a federal official\u2019s performance of official duties.\u201d He faces up to 50 years in federal prison.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThat seems a fitting outcome to a bizarre case that could have ended <em>much worse<\/em> for the victim. And who really knows what DePape would have done if his intended target, who was still speaker of the House at the time, had been at home?\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt was a strange story, made all the more confusing by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/elon-musk-paul-pelosi-tweets-link-to-conspiracy-theory-santa-monica-observer\/\" target=\"_blank\">wild online conjecture<\/a> early on about DePape\u2019s motives and his possible relationship with Pelosi. (He had none; the two men did not know each other.)\n<\/p><p>\n\tAround 2 a.m. on October 28, 2022, DePape smashed a window to enter Pelosi\u2019s Pacific Heights mansion. He had zip ties and rope with him. DePape awoke the sleeping Paul Pelosi, demanding, \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy?\u201d Pelosi replied that she was in Washington, D.C. Undeterred, DePape told Pelosi he would tie him up until she arrived. For whatever reason, he didn\u2019t.\n<\/p><p>\n\tDePape testified last week that he planned to compel Pelosi and other politicians, including U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and California Governor Gavin Newsom (D), to \u201cadmit to their corruption\u201d and then have Joe Biden pardon them all.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s just easier giving them a pardon so we can move forward as a country,\u201d DePape tearfully told the court.\n<\/p><p>\n\tSounds like a brilliant scheme of a criminal mastermind, doesn\u2019t it?\n<\/p><p>\n\tPaul Pelosi told the court that he remained calm and managed to call 911. When police arrived, things got even weirder. Pelosi greeted the officers at the door in his underwear, which fueled some silly speculation that the men were having a tryst. Soon after officers entered the house, DePape began beating Pelosi with the hammer, leaving him with a cracked skull and injuries to his right arm and both hands.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn the days following the attack, the press scrambled to figure out just who the assailant was.\n<\/p><p>\n\tDePape\u2019s background was strange. He lived in a garage and on a broken-down bus. He had been a Green Party member and \u201cpro-nudity activist.\u201d A former girlfriend told the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfchronicle.com\/bayarea\/article\/ex-girlfriend-of-suspect-in-paul-pelosi-attack-17545968.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Chronicle<\/a> days after the attack that \u201cthat mental illness and drug use had caused [DePape] to deteriorate so profoundly that he ... grew convinced ... \u2018he was Jesus for a year.\u2019\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tDePape \u201cis a broken child in an adult body with serious mental problems,\u201d Oxane \u201cGypsy\u201d Taub told the paper.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhen DePape took the stand in his own defense last week, he broke down in tears as he attempted to explain his motivations, saying he was \u201cfueled by conspiracy theories and right-wing media,\u201d CBS News Bay Area <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/sanfrancisco\/news\/david-depape-testifies-paul-pelosi-hammer-attack-trial\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\n\tDePape told the court he \u201cmainly watched YouTube videos and listened to podcasts from the likes of Tim Pool, Glenn Beck, and conservative media outlets,\u201d according to the CBS News story. \u201cHe described his worldview as taking up a battle against a sinister cabal of government officials, celebrities, and pedophiles driving the country to ruin, echoing baseless Q-Anon diatribes.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tOh, boy. Here we go again.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOver the years, criminal defendants have mounted all manner of novel defenses and offered elaborate excuses for their crimes, from \u201cI didn\u2019t know the gun was loaded\u201d to \u201cI hit her 41 times with an axe in self-defense.\u201d That one actually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.texasmonthly.com\/news-politics\/candy-montgomery-hypnosis-junk-science-love-and-death\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">worked<\/a>!\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn 1979, Dan White\u2019s attorneys famously argued that the former San Francisco city councilman\u2019s use of anti-depressants led him to binge on sweets, which contributed to his unraveled state of mind that led him to shoot and kill Mayor George Moscone and fellow council member Harvey Milk. This became known as \u201cthe Twinkie defense.\u201d That one worked, too \u2014 to a point. The jury found White guilty on lesser charges of manslaughter, rather than first-degree murder, likely sparing him a death sentence.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOnce upon a time, DePape might have said \u201cthe Devil made me do it.\u201d But since we no longer believe in the Devil, Glenn Beck and the ever-present Protean scourge of \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d will more than suffice.\n<\/p><p>\n\tBlaze News readers know Beck has had a long and storied career in broadcasting and print. He\u2019s a figure of controversy, sure. And he\u2019s made some mistakes and had a few regrets over the years, which he has discussed candidly.\n<\/p><p>\n\tReflecting on his time at Fox News, as far back as 2014 Beck told Megyn Kelly, \u201cI wish I could go back and be more uniting in my language. Because I think I played a role unfortunately in helping tear the country apart. And it\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt\u2019s fair to say that Beck has long since shifted his approach from the old divisiveness to something more conciliatory. But that hasn\u2019t diminished his passion. In a 2018 broadcast, for example, he railed against Chris Cuomo and CNN for amplifying QAnon and purposefully dividing the country. Did DePape miss that one?\n<\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8e1e4c2b3ecaced6a141c67c674ef882\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/L6xT0vQT4EQ?rel=0&start=294\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">CNN peddles Bizarre Conspiracy Theory<\/small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=L6xT0vQT4EQ&t=294s\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com<\/a>\n\n        <\/small>\n        <\/p><p>The truth is that Beck frequently denounces violence and extremism of all kinds and offers ways to unite positively against those vices.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn March, following the shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glennbeck.com\/glenn-beck\/message-to-america-nashville\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beck told his audience<\/a>, \u201cIt is natural for all of us to feel anger and fear during these times, and it may seem unnatural to rise above it. But we must. It's essential to remember that we have to come together as a society, together, and address the root causes of violence.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cThe seeds of division have been sown by those who seek to manipulate and exploit us for their own gain,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThey shatter our trust in one another to instill fear and hatred where there should be understanding and compassion.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tBeck is not offering \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d He is <em>making arguments<\/em>. Left-wing outlets such as the New Republic and the Guardian might not be able to tell the difference \u2014 or maybe they don\u2019t expect their readers to know and see it. But it\u2019s true.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt should go without saying, but since we live in exceptionally obtuse times, I need to say it anyway: Glenn Beck didn\u2019t \u201cradicalize\u201d David DePape. He didn\u2019t tell DePape to cross the Bay Bridge, break into the Pelosi mansion, and demand to know the whereabouts of the speaker of the House. He didn\u2019t put the hammer in DePape\u2019s hand.\n<\/p><p>\n\tFor the record, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glennbeck.com\/radio\/glenn-what-i-think-happened-during-the-paul-pelosi-attack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here is what the man himself said<\/a> about DePape a few days after the attack:\n<\/p><blockquote>Know that he is supposedly a fan of mine. He is a nudist. I can see all the nudists just loving this program. He is a hippie. Love it. He lives in San Francisco. Love it. Black Lives Matter supporter. Love it. QAnon supporter. Hmmm. You don't get a lot of QAnon news from this program, do you?<br\/>\n<br\/>\n\tHe also apparently loved Pizzagate. You mean the thing that I said from the beginning was nonsense? Really, that thing?\n<br\/>\n\tHe was also \u2014 and if you listen to this program, you can see why he was a fan \u2014 he hated Jews. Interesting that he\u2019d be a fan of the one who won the Defender of Israel award. Really strange because I\u2019ve been talking about anti-Semitism on the rise for more than 20 years ...<br\/>\n<br\/>\n\tHe also said that equity was the dog whistle for the genocide of the white race. That\u2019s also something we took on recently and said was absolutely ridiculous. ... You can see we had a lot in common. That doesn't make sense, does it?<\/blockquote><p>\n\tWhat does make sense is that David DePape is a profoundly disturbed man who has spent much of his adult life on drugs and struggling with mental illness. He dwelled in the fever swamps of the Bay Area left until he drifted into the fever swamps of the very online QAnon right.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTaub, the ex-girlfriend, may have come closest to putting her finger on what accounts for DePape\u2019s worldview in her interview with the Chronicle.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cHe was against the government,\u201d Taub said by phone from the California Institution for Women in Riverside County, where she was serving time \u201con an unrelated charge.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cBut if anything, he was opposed to the shadow government, against the people who really run the government and use politicians as puppets. Like Trump was a puppet. David and I were against the shadow government.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n That might help explain a thing or two about DePape\u2019s addled thinking. But it doesn\u2019t excuse what DePape did. Happily, his Glenn Beck deflection didn\u2019t work and he will likely be going to prison for a long time. Maybe there he can get some of the help \u2014 and the clarity \u2014 he so desperately needs.<\/p>",

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/why-i-ripped-deion-sanders-all-football-season.jpg?id=50522562&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>At this point, Deion Sanders has more in common with Jim Jones than with Nick Saban.<br\/><\/p><p>Jones, of course, is one of America\u2019s most notorious cult leaders. In the 1960s and \u201970s, he used a mash-up of Christian theology, Marxism, racial idolatry, and \u201csocial justice\u201d to convince a large group of followers to relocate to a jungle in South America. He promised his congregants they would build an oppression-free paradise in Guyana. <\/p><p>A little more than a year after their arrival, on November 18, 1978, Jones talked his church members into drinking cyanide-laced Flavor Aid. Nine hundred and nine people died. Seventy percent of Jones\u2019 followers were black. Forty-five percent of them were black women. <\/p><p>Abused Christian theology, Marxism, racial idolatry, and \u201csocial justice\u201d have been combined and used repeatedly to make fools of black Americans. Too often, black people find racialized religious doctrine irresistible. <\/p><p>In hopes of building an oppression-free football paradise in Boulder, Colorado, Deion Sanders has used the same formula as Jim Jones. Coach Prime cast himself as one cup evangelical motivator, a tablespoon of racial justice warrior, a gallon of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d and a full-blown useful idiot for Marxists. <\/p><p>Throughout the fall, black celebrities and sports fans flocked to one of the whitest locales in America to worship at the feet of their football cult leader, buying whatever apparel or other nonsense Coach Prime sold. After a 3-0 start, Deion was \u201cCoach Deity,\u201d an untouchable hero, a threat to Nick Saban as college football\u2019s greatest coach. Any critique of Sanders brought allegations of racism or race betrayal.<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Coach Prime epitomizes unrepentant idolatry. He\u2019s been the spokesman for the pleasures of idolatry for 40 years.<\/p><p>Coach Deity had turned Colorado\u2019s years-long football whine into life-sustaining water. <\/p><p>Well, late Friday night and early Saturday morning \u2014 on November 18, 2023 \u2014 the Coach Prime cult suffered its Deiontown Massacre. In the battle for last place in the PAC-12 Conference, the Washington State Cougars destroyed Coach Prime\u2019s Buffaloes, 56-14.<\/p><p>That\u2019s right. For all the hype and bluster, Deion\u2019s rebuilt Buffaloes will finish in the same spot as last year\u2019s team \u2014 looking up at every other team in the conference. Even with an unlikely victory in the season finale \u2014 a road game against Utah \u2014 Colorado cannot escape the Pac-12 basement. At best, it can finish tied for last place with a 2-7 conference record. <\/p><p>For those of you who drank the Coach Prime Flavor Aid, thankfully all you will suffer is wounded pride and ego.<\/p><p>I hope this is a teachable moment about the dangers of falling for a cult of personality and of pledging allegiance to anyone based on skin color rather than a solid set of values. <\/p><p>Throughout the football season, I have been repeatedly ridiculed and demonized for criticizing Deion\u2019s coaching style and methods. I have been accused of being obsessed with the Hall of Fame football legend. <\/p><p>My genuine obsession is with sharing a worldview that leads to improved decision-making and rids people of their idolatry. We live in an era ruled by idolatry, the religious worship of idols, whether it be food, sex, money, popularity, material goods, youth, race, or the alleged \u201cheroes\u201d and influencers popular culture celebrates. Idols control our behavior and interfere with our obedience to the truths spelled out in the Bible. <\/p><p>I suffer from idolatry. The only idol I\u2019ve truly conquered is hero worship. Everything else remains a day-to-day struggle, a battle I fight with prayer, meditation, song, and study of the Word. <\/p><p>I also fight idolatry by engaging in daily conversations about its dangers. Deion and Colorado football provided me with the perfect topic to analyze the pitfalls of idolatry consistently. <\/p><p>Coach Prime epitomizes unrepentant idolatry. He\u2019s been the spokesman for the pleasures of idolatry for 40 years. While claiming Christian faith, he flamboyantly and unapologetically chases money, popularity, youth, material possessions, sex, pride, and racial justice. <\/p><p>His cult followers defend his lack of repentance by arguing, \u201cHe\u2019s always been this way. Deion hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d His defenders claim Deion has mastered the art of being \u201crelatable\u201d to kids. <\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">It\u2019s not impossible to win football games with Deion\u2019s immature and secular approach. But games are not worth winning if the approach sours souls rather than saves them.<\/p><p>Their defenses are an indictment. No man should relish his inability to evolve and mature. And no grown man, especially a father and leader, should desire to be \u201crelatable\u201d to kids. That\u2019s not our role. We should want to be seen as wise. <\/p><p>A child should relate to his peers and seek wisdom from adults. The pursuit of \u201crelatability\u201d acts as a beard for avoidance of the responsibility of manhood. Deion doesn\u2019t want to grow up. He\u2019s made youthfulness an idol. The gold chains, the hoodie, the sunglasses, the friendship with rappers half his age are all symptoms of his fear of aging. <\/p><p>We all can relate to that. I certainly can. I dye my hair three or four times a year. Getting old is uncomfortable and scary. It\u2019s pointless to fight it. Rather than fight a losing battle, we should spend our last days sharing all that we know with the younger generations. <\/p><p>The sharing of wisdom lessens the chance of the next generation repeating our mistakes. <\/p><p>I spent the entire college football season attempting to educate fans about how Deion\u2019s early success was fool\u2019s gold. It was never sustainable. Colorado\u2019s offensive strategy allowed Deion\u2019s son to pad his stats at quarterback, but it undermined the development of the offensive line and cost the team games later in the season. <\/p><p>Deion\u2019s insistence on centering himself and his Coach Prime brand worked against building the kind of locker-room chemistry that could handle inevitable adversity. Deion\u2019s outsized, hey-look-at-me persona guaranteed that his team would always face an emotionally inspired opponent. <\/p><p>Beyond the winning and losing, Deion\u2019s representation of Christian faith was always most problematic. Deion\u2019s remarkable lack of humility calls into question the sincerity of his faith.<\/p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/playlist.megaphone.fm\/?e=BMDC4993445574\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>You cannot claim the King of kings while making yourself the king. Deion made himself an idol. He sought victory through trying to persuade his players, the media, and fans to worship him.<br\/><\/p><p>Of all of his blasphemous slogans, \u201cI am him\u201d is the worst. <\/p><p>More than anyone, I hope that Deion Sanders has learned the most from my Daily Dose of Deion segments and columns. It\u2019s never too late to learn, repent, and transform.<\/p><p>Deion has much wisdom to share if he\u2019s capable of self-evaluation. He can put away his gold chains, the rap music, his desire to be popular and relatable. He can build a locker-room culture centered around uplifting and educating every player on the team. <\/p><p>It\u2019s not impossible to win football games with Deion\u2019s immature and secular approach. But games are not worth winning if the approach sours souls rather than saves them.<\/p>",

Mike Turner (R-Ohio) on Sunday when he explained why President Joe Biden should face consequences for retaining classified documents.<\/p><p>Several news outlets reported last week that special counsel Robert Hur, appointed to investigate Biden's retention of classified documents at his post-vice presidential office in Washington and his personal residence in Delaware, will conclude his investigation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/special-counsel-biden-classified-docs\" target=\"_blank\">giving the president nothing more than a public scolding<\/a> for violating laws prohibiting the improper retention of classified documents.<\/p><p>On \"Face the Nation,\" Brennan asked what signal not charging Biden sends to the \"national security world.\" Turner, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made clear it's not a good one.<\/p><p>\"This will be certainly devastating, continuing to be devastating, for the Department of Justice and to the Biden administration with their two-tier system of justice,\"  he said. <\/p><p><span><\/span>\"Biden has been found to be a serial classified document hoarder. Over a 10-year period, he's been taking classified documents \u2014 some of the most sensitive that threaten our national security \u2014 home without any protection, and certainly able for others to be able to access them,\" Turner explained.<\/p><p>If Biden is let off scot-free, Turner said it will be clear that leaders of only one party face consequences for improper retention and storage of classified information.<\/p><p is=\"qowt-word-para\">\"There needs to be consequences,\" he said. \"The fact that Hillary Clinton, who had over 100 classified documents at home when she was secretary of state, and Vice President Biden, both under Obama at the same time, were taking classified documents home and certainly had them be vulnerable, with no consequences, shows the Department of Justice is not pursuing Democrats.\"<\/p><p is=\"qowt-word-para\">It was at that point that Brennan attempted to defend Biden, suggesting that Donald Trump did worse and therefore the double standard is justified.<\/p><p is=\"qowt-word-para\">\"As you know, there is a difference with the case against President Trump, who refused to hand over documents fully and violated the Espionage Act \u2014 that's the charge against him \u2014 because he didn't work with the government to hand those over,\" the anchor said.<br\/><\/p><p is=\"qowt-word-para\">But Turner made it clear that Trump's alleged wrongdoing does not absolve Biden's.<\/p><p is=\"qowt-word-para\">\"As you know, Margaret, Biden had these documents for over 10 years,\" Turner snapped back.<\/p><p is=\"qowt-word-para\">\"You can't hoard documents in your home for a decade-long period, concealing them, taking them home as a senator, vice president, and then suddenly say, 'Hey, two weeks while I was president, I cooperated and, therefore, it doesn't count that I spent 10 years as a serial classified document hoarder,'\" he added.<\/p><p is=\"qowt-word-para\">And with that, Brennan ended the interview.<\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"1352c617650649970ff9e8d1262f23ca\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hJI9EHVDHow?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Rep.

Biden even awarded him the Presidential Citizens Medal, and several media outlets invited him on their shows to share his harrowing account of that fateful day.\n<\/p><p>\n\tBut as more evidence is unearthed, it\u2019s looking more and more like Dunn\u2019s testimony, which he gave under oath, as well as the recount he gives in his new memoir, are \u201cobviously disprovable\" lies, says Glenn Beck.\n<\/p><p>\n\tFor example, \u201cDunn alleged that he was called the N-word numerous times during the riot at the Capitol on January 6th, [and] almost the entirety of the media repeated his claim without any question,\u201d Beck explains.\n<\/p><p>\n\tHowever, Blaze Media has acquired access to the J6 footage, although the tapes have not been approved for release, and can confirm that there is no evidence that racial slurs were hurled at Dunn on January 6th.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cThis is the most video-recorded event in history, [and] not a single piece of evidence, video or audio, has even emerged to confirm that such a racially charged incident ever took place,\u201d explains Glenn.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cIn the two and a half years since the events, with tens of thousands of hours of audio taken and analyzed from open-source cell phone video and D.C.

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/a-giant-case-of-corporate-bigotry.jpg?id=50518804&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C54\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\tI notice that every time I check myself out of a Giant supermarket in central Pennsylvania, I see a poster indicating that this chain store is looking for new workers. When I then look at whom the employers have in mind as potential help, I behold the picture of a young black woman. This young woman looks cheerful and attractive, but that\u2019s not the point here. The store is obviously not interested in hiring white men or even necessarily black men. It seeks to give preferential employment treatment to black women. And lest anyone doubt its purpose, Giant management underlines this preference with the picture that accompanies its help-wanted sign.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe help-wanted poster is not exactly an inoffensive adornment. It is apparent that the grocery\u2019s management is virtue-signaling and doing so in a very ugly way. It is building on the practice of our corporate capitalists who are removing white people and particularly white males from TV advertisements. Exceptions are made in these advertisements for white males with black spouses or homosexual partners or if it\u2019s possible to stick them into a group made up predominantly of approved minorities.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMind you, I\u2019m not blaming this primarily on black women. Our corporate elites, who are behind it, are mostly white and male. They apparently think that it\u2019s OK to marginalize other white males in order to exhibit their own progressive values and to win the praise of woke peers.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWe might wonder how this ostentatious virtue-signaling is different from telling job applicants that Irish, Jews, and Italians need not apply because the prospective employer doesn\u2019t like certain ethnic groups, even if he wouldn\u2019t object to taking their money in commercial transactions.\n<\/p><p>\n\tYes, I\u2019ve heard the predictable leftist cant (as a former academic, I\u2019ve had my fill of it) that this sort of thing is different from older discriminatory practices because it\u2019s what the French call \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cairn.info\/revue-pouvoirs-2004-4-page-29.htm\" target=\"_blank\">positive discrimination<\/a>.\u201d Once we\u2019ve renamed the exclusionary custom in question, it becomes an expression of the highest virtue to follow it \u2014 provided we also believe that the ancestors of those being excluded today inflicted, albeit unknowingly, indescribable suffering on the ancestors of those who are now being strenuously \u201crecruited.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tOf course, this form of discrimination is not something that the virtue-signaler does quietly. Rather, he announces his intentions nonstop and even posts pictures to make sure that everyone gets his drift. The new discrimination is even crazier than older forms because it involves rich white people with fancy degrees dehumanizing other white people.\n<\/p><p>\n\tI doubt that most of Giant\u2019s customers bother to take offense, even in our heavily pro-Trump borough, when they see white people, and particularly white males, treated as less than desirable applicants for grocery store work. They also see their sex and race marginalized or degraded on their TV screens, but they may view these unpleasant features of contemporary American culture as something over which they have no power. My neighbors may in fact feel helpless as they watch their humanity being downgraded.\n<\/p><p>\n\tHaving grown up in a factory town in the Northeast in the 1950s, I can easily imagine that some of our local businesspeople preferred hiring white employees to black employees. Some also preferred hiring members of their own ethnic groups who spoke their ancestral languages (usually Hungarian or Italian where I lived) as opposed to employing those who seemed culturally more alien.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAlthough my father had at least one black employee, I don\u2019t recall him ever celebrating this as a mark of virtue. He hired the employees he thought would do the work he needed them to do. Whether they were black or white didn\u2019t matter from his business perspective.\n<\/p><p>\n\tSignificantly, I don\u2019t remember from my youth any grocery store owner putting up posters that showed the ethnic type he wanted to employ. Such conduct would have seemed gauche and even un-American. You just didn\u2019t do those things back then, even if you wanted to hire a Sicilian-American man as opposed to a Hungarian-American lady to stack cans in your shop window.\n<\/p><p>\n\tNow things have changed. We show off our bigotry as proud agents of an anti-discrimination regime, the very essence of which is a morbid commitment to discrimination in the name of anti-discrimination.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAlthough I myself have not always been consistent in this practice, it seems that the only solution to the problem I have outlined is the enforcement of boycotts. Corporations that discriminate against white people and males in their advertisements should have their products massively boycotted. What worked for Bud Light could very well work for normal Americans in other situations. One may not be able to change the values of middle-level executives whose minds have been drenched with woke clich\u00e9s. But one can make them pay for their bigotry; and one should begin this demanding task by pushing back against crude advertising.\n<\/p>",

It reaffirmed my opposition to this legislative trend, even though such laws would be financially lucrative to my business and me personally. The Texas state legislature last week removed universal school choice from a massive reform package. Lawmakers were wise to do so, for several reasons.\n<\/p><p>\n\tFirst, school choice fosters economic dependency on government funding. Second, it is not a \u201cfree-market\u201d solution. Finally, it isn\u2019t a \n\t<em>conservative<\/em> policy, even if the big think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity have jumped on board the taxpayer gravy train. Hats off to Texas legislators for not jumping into the deep end with Senate Bill 1, as other states have done and, I believe, will later regret.\n<\/p><p>\n\tHave you seen the shirt that says, \u201cI don\u2019t co-parent with the government\u201d? If universal school choice is enacted, then everyone will be co-parenting with the government.\n<\/p><p>\n\tDemand-side economics is why we\u2019ve experienced massive inflation around the United States. A Heritage Foundation study that concluded Arizona-style education savings accounts are not inflationary is deceptive, in part because the study\u2019s authors didn\u2019t use data that reflects the current laws being passed. The Heritage study based its findings on school choice that targets individuals with learning disabilities and low incomes, as opposed to people already paying for their child\u2019s private education.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn short, Heritage compared apples to oranges and advocates oranges because of apples. That isn\u2019t sound reasoning.\n<\/p><p>\n\tBesides, since when has relying on the government to subsidize healthy middle-class and rich families\u2019 income ever been considered \u201cconservative\u201d policy?\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\tGovernment funding of school choice creates economic dependency, it is not a free-market solution, and it isn\u2019t a conservative policy in any sense of the term.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAdvocates of universal vouchers and ESAs argue they are a \u201cfree-market\u201d solution. Not really. Someone pushing universal school choice once told me that a free market is when the government gives everyone the same amount of money and they can spend it anywhere they want. All I could think of was Inigo Montoya from \u201cThe \n\t<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0093779\/\" target=\"_blank\">Princess Bride<\/a><\/u>\u201d: \u201cYou keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tInvestopedia defines a \u201cfree market\u201d as \u201cone where voluntary exchange and the laws of supply and demand provide the sole basis for the economic system, without government intervention.\u201d Clearly, the government giving families $8,000 a year, sourced from their neighbors\u2019 taxes, is \n\t<em>not<\/em> a free-market solution.\n<\/p><p>\n\tA system of universal basic education income is not a conservative policy. It is a neo-liberal policy. Just wait for Amazon, Disney, Microsoft, and Apple to start buying up schools and implementing their ESG goals on all private school platforms. Wait until they start data-mining your kids. Just wait for China to start buying up private school platforms and data-mining your children.\n<\/p><p>\n\tLet me leave you with a story. My friend Rachel is a leader for \n\t<u><a href=\"https:\/\/classicalconversations.com\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classical Conversations<\/a><\/u> in Arizona, and we don\u2019t let our Christian leaders take neo-liberal school choice funds. She was recently talking to a friend who had taken the ESA money and was so happy to have the funds.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cI used to have to work part-time to homeschool,\u201d her friend told her. \u201cI would have my aunt come over and watch the kids for me so that I could go to work. Now I don\u2019t have to do that!\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tRachel, being trained in the tools of rhetoric, politely replied: \u201cSo let me make sure I understand what you\u2019re saying. You used to rely on hard work and your family, and now you rely on the government.\u201d Her friend\u2019s eyes got wide as she began to realize what she had done.\n<\/p><p>\n\tI would urge legislators to drop school choice proposals altogether, until we have a better idea of how programs that have already passed in other states are working. States\u2019 tax receipts are starting to plummet as the looming recession becomes more apparent. A state surplus in funds can quickly turn into a deficit, and welfare programs like school choice are notoriously hard to repeal, even when they become economically unsustainable.\n<\/p><p>\n\tGovernment funding of school choice creates economic dependency, it is not a free-market solution, and it simply isn\u2019t a conservative policy in any sense of the term.\n<\/p>",

Fortunately, one of the few silver linings that has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic has been a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.federationforchildren.org\/new-poll-school-choice-support-soars-from-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\">surge in support<\/a><\/u> for school choice and the enactment of a more market-driven approach to education funding: universal school choice via vouchers, commonly called education savings accounts.\n<\/p><p>\n\tUniversal school choice is a long-overdue reform that has gained momentum in recent years. Unlike the antiquated system in which state and local governments collect taxes for education and then distribute those funds directly to public schools, universal school choice distributes education tax dollars directly to parents so that they can choose the school that best fits the unique learning needs and circumstances for their child.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThis is a superior education funding process compared to the status quo because it introduces market forces, principally through competition in the education marketplace, which has been sorely lacking for far too long. It also leads to much-needed innovation in the increasingly stale, one-size-fits-all government-run education sector.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAs of 2023, approximately <u><a href=\"https:\/\/research.com\/education\/american-school-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">90% of K-12 students<\/a><\/u> in the United States attended a public school. This is not by choice. In fact, most parents would prefer their child to attend a different school rather than the one and only public option arbitrarily assigned to them based on their zip code.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThis is especially true for parents with children stuck in poor-performing and unsafe public schools located in inner cities. In recent years, as standardized test scores show, these public schools have done a miserable job of properly educating their students for a successful future.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTwo of the most appealing aspects of the school choice revolution under way across the nation are that it leads to less education spending and better academic outcomes.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\tOne way or another, the government (whether at the local, state, or federal level) is going to play a large role in the education funding system.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOn average, K-12 public schools spent <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2023\/public-school-spending.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$14,347 per pupil<\/a><\/u> in 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Meanwhile, several states, including New York, Vermont, Connecticut, and New Jersey, spent in excess of $20,000 per student. The average annual tuition rate for the nation\u2019s 22,440 private K-12 schools is much lower, at <u><a href=\"https:\/\/educationdata.org\/average-cost-of-private-school\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$12,350<\/a><\/u> per student.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn general, private schools are more affordable than public schools because they lack the enormous bureaucracies that have become commonplace in bloated public school districts. Private schools are more streamlined and devote more of their resources directly to classrooms, while public schools and their overweening district offices <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aier.org\/article\/government-schools-more-bureaucracy-lower-performance-and-higher-costs\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">divert limited resources<\/a> to countless programs that have little to do with boosting educational outcomes but lots to do with perpetuating bureaucracy.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhat\u2019s more, students attending private schools consistently outperform their public school peers on nationwide standardized tests including the <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/education\/k12\/articles\/private-school-vs-public-school\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Assessment of Educational Progress<\/a><\/u>, better known as the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tOf course, universal school choice has no shortage of critics. But most of these opponents have an agenda, and most work within the existing public school monopoly.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTake teachers' unions, for example, which have battled school choice for decades. Unions argue that school choice programs take education dollars away from public schools, harm low-income families, and widen achievement gaps. These arguments are weak, at best, considering that public school funding has increased <em>substantially<\/em> in recent years while academic outcomes have remained stagnant and achievement gaps either have remained the same or gotten worse.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOthers deride universal school choice and voucher programs as the antithesis of a free market, arguing that state and local governments should not provide large sums of money to parents for educational purposes because it is inflationary and akin to a subsidy. This is misguided.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWe live in a society in which we agree that some degree of compulsory education is necessary for the preservation of our freedoms, values, and way of life. One way or another, the government (whether at the local, state, or federal level) is going to play a large role in the education funding system. But it is much more in line with free-market principles for the government to offer education dollars directly to the consumer (parents) versus the other way around, where government showers money on the provider (in this case, the public schools).\n<\/p><p>\n\tThink of it this way: The government gives out subsidies in the form of food stamps, but it does not require that those funds be spent in a government-run grocery store. If that were the case, could you imagine how lousy the government-run grocery stores would be? The government-run grocery stores would surely know that they are the only option, which would deter improvements and innovations.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe same logic should apply to government funding for education. Under the present circumstances, government plays an outsized role in education funding. We would be vastly better off we limited the government\u2019s role by making it merely a conduit of funds directly to parents, who would use the money to ensure their children receive the best education possible \u2014 whether that\u2019s at a public school, private school, parochial school, charter school, or even homeschooling.\n<\/p>",

The original plan was to go with the movie's Sly Stallone-inspired look, but instead of a white fur coat, the Goodwill gods delivered up a perfectly sized acid-washed jean jacket. So the (sleeveless) Canadian tuxedo it was. Add to that his blond hair and the Himes six-pack (nature's compensation for shortchanging us on height) and the kid was a mini Ryan Gosling.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"All the Kens in that movie had a pull-up content and Gosling won,\" I told him. That piqued his interest. He's very competitive and runs with a particularly sporty crowd of fourth-grade boys; everyone knows exactly where they rank according to various athletic metrics.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"How many?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tI didn't know, so I guessed. \"Fifty-two.\" He nodded just enough to convey respect without admitting that he was impressed. \"I'll install a pull-up bar,\" I said.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThing is, my son <em>could<\/em> beat Gosling in a pull-up contest, if he set his mind to it. <em>I<\/em> could beat him, and I recently earned a free AARP prescription and a some intimate photos of the inside of my colon. And I bet you could beat him too. Of course, you shouldn't take any exercise advice from me that you wouldn't take from a qualified medical professional, but my point still stands. Pull-ups are wonderfully egalitarian that way.\n<\/p><p>\n\tJust ask David Goggins. Back in May he did what he thought was a new world record of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CsPVlPovN8e\/\" target=\"_blank\">7,801 pull-ups in 24 hours<\/a>. As he was submitting the evidence to Guinness, he found out another guy had just done 8,008. That record stood for a whole five months, until an Australian policeman named <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/reel\/CycxVT-yjYS\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Lloyd hit 8,600<\/a>. Quoth Goggins, <strong>\"<\/strong>There is always some motherf**ker out there working harder than you hunting your ass.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tGet your form in order first. None of that CrossFit kipping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ofMO09Rz-YA\" target=\"_blank\">like Mark Wahlberg did<\/a> when he said he could do more pull-ups than Dwayne Johnson. You want explosive on the way up and slow and controlled on the way down. Don't use momentum; use your back muscles. Keep your core engaged the whole time. Use an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder width, knuckles up so your wrists and not your fingers do the work. Hit the bar with your sternum to encourage proper form, and use your full range of motion. More detailed information on form <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sIvJTfGxdFo\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/thegravgear.com\/blogs\/calisthenics\/perfect-pull-up\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\n\tYou don't need an in-house pull-up bar, but I spend much of the work day hunched over my computer about 15 steps from my bed, so I like the idea of banging out a set every couple of paragraphs. The bar I bought is a Rogue Jammer pull-up bar in red knurled Cerakote. Pricey, but Rogue is arguably best in class when it comes to made-in-the-USA fitness products, and we're talking about potentially tens of thousands of future reps here. Besides, those cheap ones you wedge in the doorframe never seem to fit my doors. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.titan.fitness\/strength\/strength-accessories\/pull-up-bars\/adjustable-depth-wall-mounted-pull-up-bar\/400513.html\" target=\"_blank\">Titan Fitness<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fringesport.com\/collections\/pull-up-bars\" target=\"_blank\">Fringe Sport<\/a> also offer American-made wall-mounted bars that come highly recommended, while FitBar makes the best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fitbarstrong.com\/doorway-pull-up-bar\" target=\"_blank\">doorway pull-up bar<\/a> I've seen.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWomen should pay heed as well. Forget leaning in \u2014 what about pulling up? Yes, your relatively weak upper body strength can make it seem impossible, but you haven't met <a href=\"https:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/athletes-celebrities\/pro-tips\/winning-strategy-angela-gargano-is-helping-women-pullup-to-higher-levels\/\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Gargano<\/a> yet.

With the federal government ignoring immigration law, it is the right and responsibility of red states to defend their own people.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTo that end, after several years of dawdling, the Texas legislature last week finally passed SB 4, which empowers state and local law enforcement to arrest illegal aliens for their illegal entry into the state. Given that the effects of the invasion plague every major city, the Texas bill needs to be the beginning of a paradigm shift in the way states address the crisis.\n<\/p><p>\n\tSB 4 also grants state judges authority to return illegal aliens to Mexico. In some instances, however, the crime of entering the state illegally would be punishable by up to six months in jail for first-time offenders and two years for a second offense. The bill <a href=\"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/TX\/bill\/SB4\/2023\/X4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed<\/a> the Texas House 83-61 along party lines and the Senate 17-11, with one Republican voting with the Democrats.\n<\/p><h2>\n\tWhat happens in Texas doesn\u2019t stay in Texas\n<\/h2><p>\n\tThe lone dissenting Republican senator was Brian Birdwell, a co-author of an earlier, watered-down version of SB 4. He <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/11\/15\/politics\/texas-border-bill\/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">claimed<\/a> Texas was setting a \u201cterrible precedent\u201d by \u201cinvalidating our obedience and faithfulness to our Constitution\u201d \u2014 which specifies that \u201call power and responsibility for immigration is delegated to the federal government.\u201d\n<\/p><p>Funny enough, I can\u2019t find a provision in the Constitution that says anything close to that. Naturalization is an enumerated power of Congress under Article I, Section 8. But immigration \u2014 especially the power to block a flood of would-be squatters crossing the border \u2014 was regulated by the states for the first 100 years or so of our nation\u2019s history.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">We need to set up a direct challenge to <em>Plyler v. Doe,<\/em> much as red states did with <em>Roe v. Wade<\/em>.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAt the same time, both houses <a href=\"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/TX\/bill\/SB3\/2023\/X4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">passed SB 3<\/a>, which would provide $1.5 billion for the maintenance, operation, and construction of border barrier infrastructure, including about 100 miles of border wall.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAlso, in response to my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/cis.org\/Report\/Americas-Public-Schools-Canaries-Coal-Mine-Biden-Border-Crisis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Todd Bensman\u2019s phenomenal reporting<\/a> about the massive illegal alien community of Colony Ridge just east of Houston, SB 3 provides $40 million for the Texas Department of Public Safety to police this growing violent area. Apparently, the cartels have been operating in Colony Ridge with impunity. The community drew public attention <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/05\/03\/us\/cleveland-texas-shooting-fransisco-oropesa-arrest-wednesday\/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">when a Honduran illegal alien<\/a> murdered five people earlier this year.\n<\/p><p>\n\tSB 4 is the bill that every state needs to pass, not just the border states. What comes to the border doesn\u2019t remain at the border. It migrates to our cities, well beyond the Rio Grande.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnd the cost to Texans is massive. According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/texasscorecard.com\/state\/the-costs-of-texas-porous-southern-border\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a> from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office, illegal aliens cost the state $152 million for housing, between $62 million and $90 million in Medicaid expenditures, and somewhere between $579 million and $717 million for uncompensated hospital care.\n<\/p><p>\n\tYet Texas is not unique. Every state bears the burden of illegal aliens, from the crimes they commit to the public services they consume. It\u2019s simply a fact. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fairus.org\/issue\/publications-resources\/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers-2023\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federation for American Immigration Reform study<\/a> found that illegal immigration cost U.S. taxpayers at least $182 billion this year alone, with states picking up nearly two-thirds of the tab.\n<\/p><h2>\n\tA legal war worth waging\n<\/h2><p>\n\tObviously, the left will fight SB 4 in court, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/press-releases\/aclu-tx-condemns-unconstitutional-anti-immigrant-bills\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the ACLU<\/a> is already preparing a lawsuit. But now is the time to set up a direct challenge to <em>U.S. v. Arizona<\/em>, the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision that barred states from enforcing immigration law.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWe need every red state to follow the Lone Star State\u2019s lead but with one major addition: removing the lure of \u201cfree\u201d public education, which is crushing many local communities. In some school districts, <a href=\"https:\/\/cis.org\/Report\/Mapping-Impact-Immigration-Public-Schools\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30%-40%<\/a> of the student body are foreign-born and in the United States illegally.

Last month, police in Fairfax County, Virginia, briefly detained a Honduran national on rape and kidnapping charges. Border Patrol had caught and released the same man two years ago. Immigration and Customs Enforcement asked Fairfax to keep the man in custody, but the Fairfax County jail did not honor the detainer and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ice.gov\/news\/releases\/ero-washington-dc-apprehends-noncitizen-charged-rape-kidnapping-assault\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released<\/a> an accused illegal alien rapist back onto the streets.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIf blue states can release rapists, why can\u2019t red states arrest and deport them? At a minimum, it is their right to deny all public services to trespassers. SB 4 is a great start and potential model for the nation to address and reverse the crisis of 8 million illegal aliens who have entered the United States during Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous tenure.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe critical element, of course, is how eagerly Texas Governor Greg Abbott will enforce the law. We\u2019ll see.\n<\/p>",

I remember the floors in our house were just packed dirt. We had no running water, no electricity.

My parents were quite strict with that. I had a lot of questions as a kid, and I don't think my parents were equipped with the answers. Like what the resurrection was. I did go to Bible studies as a child, and by my early teens I had read the Bible twice but without really understanding it. I remember going to church as a child, being bored out of my mind, and getting down on the floor with the tithe envelopes and the little pencils that were there and just drawing. One of the things I really want to be able to do with my son when he asks questions is not to respond with \u201cthat\u2019s just what we believe\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s what faith is.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"\">I ended up going astray in a way. It\u2019s not that I went around thinking about it, saying, \u201cI'm an atheist.\u201d I just didn't care.I discovered punk rock at a very early age. I don't want to blame that for my decision to walk away from God. Because I think the same free-thinking [urge] to question everything is what actually brought me back to God.<\/p><p style=\"\">I've heard a lot more inspiring testimony than my own. Mine isn\u2019t that crazy. I was just searching for answers and meaning in the wrong places like most people do. I ran away when I was 14. I came back, and I had a mohawk. I had started getting tattooed. This was a shock to my poor parents. At the time there weren\u2019t any TV shows that normalized tattoos; to my parents, the only people getting tattooed were gang members, prostitutes, or drug addicts. They really believed their child was possessed by a demon.<\/p><p style=\"\">At one point my parents were pretty desperate to \u201cfix\u201d me. So they sent me off to a \u201cschool\u201d that was essentially a lockdown facility. And there was a lot of abuse. I endured some mental abuse but thankfully avoided the physical abuse I saw others endure. I was there for about six months until I lied my way out. And then I was taken to a kind of transitional boarding school.<\/p><p style=\"\">At about 16 or 17, I started drinking. Not for fun; it was probably to cope with some of the trauma. When I came back home, my parents and I both agreed I should move out; it just wasn\u2019t good for any of us. By then I had started tattooing and was making good money for a teenager and living in San Bernardino, which is about an hour and a half from L.A.<\/p><p style=\"\">I fell in love with tattooing. I really saw that as a calling. I was good at it. I was good at people. I was a good listener. And I was an artist. I jumped to another tattoo shop with more experienced artists, and then I made my way to Los Angeles. And from there I just got on TV.<\/p><p style=\"\">I was never the type of person who wanted to be on TV to be famous. I just love tattooing. And I wanted to be a good representation of the industry. I first got on a show called \"Miami Ink.\" I was barely 21. At this point I was full-blown alcoholic. I was drinking all the time. I got introduced to drugs at that point, but I was functioning. Somehow I miraculously showed up to work every day, and I did a great job. It was a miserable experience. The other cast and I just didn\u2019t get along. I signed the contract while I was drunk. I didn\u2019t have a lawyer. I [ended up] signing away the rights to my name, my likeness, my art, and everything I created. To nullify that contract, I was offered \"LA Ink,\" and it opened up my shop in L.A., which I had for about 12 years.<\/p><p style=\"\">I was a seeker. I wasn't really actively pursuing any belief system. I just was sad. I was drinking, and I was trying to find answers in the wrong places. And it wasn't until I got sober, which will be 17 years ago this July, that I really started wanting to fix myself. And that's when I started getting into a lot of the New Age stuff and self-help books and a lot of meditation<\/p><p style=\"\">I started learning about Transcendental Meditation. But it felt like patching a sinking ship with a Band-Aid. I would think, \u201cThis feels really good. And I'm so at peace.\u201d I'd have anxiety at the airport, and I'd go into the bathroom and say my mantra and I\u2019d be fine. But it was a crutch.<\/p><p style=\"\">I'm not going to diss on the AA program, because it helps a lot of people. But when I got sober, I didn\u2019t go to AA. I did read \"The Big Book,\" which I loved. And I still love that book. I think in general everybody would benefit from a 12-step program, doing your inventory and making amends and doing all that stuff. That was very helpful for me. <\/p><p style=\"\">[In AA] they talk about having a higher power. And that's the part where I\u2019m like, \u201cI feel like you're missing the God part.\u201d Because your higher power can be this cactus in the corner. It can be Ozzy Osbourne. Whereas for me, I've been sober for a long time, but I don't feel like I was free from alcohol until I found God.<\/p><p style=\"\">I kind of blame my husband for starting it. When the lockdowns happened, he said, \u201cI think we got a lot of things wrong.\u201d And he started showing me articles and some videos. And I started rethinking a lot of things that I thought were true, and it was the first step into questioning everything I had been doing. At the time BLM was going hard, I was in the middle of it [in Los Angeles]. I lived three doors down from the mayor. So we had Antifa in our front yard threatening people with Molotov cocktails and stuff like that. We were seeing things in real time. And they were much worse than what you saw on TV.<\/p><p style=\"\">I started going down the list of what I was doing with my life and what my perspectives were. When I got to my spirituality, that's where I started really rethinking a lot of things. A friend had sent me a sermon from Pastor Jack Hibbs. And I loved it. It really spoke to me and answered a lot of questions that I had At the time, my son was still a baby and I wasn't going to church. But would we would watch the sermons every Sunday. And I just desired more and more and more, so I started studying the Bible.<\/p><p>[In 2020] I posted this post on Instagram where I just took a picture of a good chunk of these books from my library that I just wanted to get rid of. I don't want to say that they were haunting me, but I knew they were there. Everybody honed in on the witchcraft books, but I also threw away all my meditation books and books on yoga. I prayed a lot before posting that. I spent time writing that caption because I knew I wanted to start being able to talk about where I'm at in life.<\/p><p style=\"\">I came to this really awesome realization that night that I don't want these crutches in my life any more. I just want Jesus, and it's a very narrow, a narrow road, right? All these breathing techniques, or spell work or nature worship \u2014 they're just crutches. They\u2019re not really the answer. I would rather eliminate any distractions. It was a symbolic gesture, proclaiming where I stand. And it was crazy to watch the reaction in the comments. It was like demons hissing at each other. And it was coming from both sides. People who said \u201cI don't think Aleister Crowley's evil\u201d and then Christians attacking those people.<\/p><p style=\"\">That night, two people came to my house. We lived in L.A. at the time and had a gated security system. I was upstairs with my son and the doorbell rang. My husband looked at the video screen, and it was this possessed person saying, \u201cHi, I don\u2019t want to freak you out, but I just want to know if I could please have those books. I really need those books. I need those books.\u201d And you could see the darkness in their eyes.<\/p><p style=\"\">I think a lot of people, especially in the Christian community, call everything demonic. And I don't think everything is demonic. But in this case, I think it was. This person was possessed and no longer in control of themselves. People get obsessed with fame or with the desire to bring certain evils into your life. My husband ushered him away, but then a second person came and tried to break into our trash cans [to find my books]. It was a very sobering moment for me. I realized I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with this any more.<\/p><p style=\"\">I have a lot of friends who are into stuff like tarot cards. And I love them so much and think I have more empathy and understanding than the average person, because I've been there. But there\u2019s always this drama and dread and doom and gloom. But I would look around at my Christian friends and think, \u201cI want what you have.\u201d They\u2019re not perfect by any means, but I love the light they have.<\/p><p style=\"\">I wasn't born into a Baptist church. I'm seeking more traditionalism. When it comes to my worship, I don't want to go to a concert. We all dress nice when we go to church. And that's just our own personal thing, like, this is a sacred space. And I feel like other [churches] just didn't really align with what I'm looking for. I feel like God just, like, spit me out on the doorsteps of the most perfect church for us. It\u2019s a very small congregation. It's a lot of old people. I have anxiety about being late. And so I got there too early and interrupted their prayer circle. And these people just stood up and embraced us. And they didn't really care about who people think we are. They just said, \u201cYou're the lady that bought the house down the street. And we've been praying for you.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"\">After I posted my baptism video, I saw a lot of sensationalized headlines. I was never in a cult. I was never a witch. I was definitely not a satanist. I know I look and dress like a villain. I've been documenting my life since I was 20. And I, this was one of the most important days of my life. I wanted to document it just like I would document my wedding and to share it with the world. Part of it for me was making amends with my followers, because for so many years I've been putting out a certain message. So to publicly proclaim this was me setting some things right.<\/p><p style=\"\">I have no intention of cutting off my friends whom I don\u2019t agree with. I don't think Jesus would either. I got a lot of criticism from Christians after I posted that baptism video. I think that Christians, when you do that, you don't realize how much harm you're doing. Some of the comments were really cruel and annoyingly holier than thou. And I would look at some of them and say, \u201cWhat is to be gained from this comment? Who does it help? Does it help me? Does it help all my other followers?\u201d<\/p><p style=\"\">[They said,] \u201cHer hand wasn't completely submerged.\u201d So this is fake, or it doesn't count. You have to be fully submerged. But I was holding on to Pastor Brian's hands and I weigh 150 pounds and he\u2019s an older gentleman. I was thankful he didn't drop me. And then other people were like, she's faking it. This is just for a PR stunt.<\/p><p style=\"\">My dad plays a trumpet, and he ended up doing a trumpet version of \u201cMy Tribute\u201d when I was in the back getting ready to go in the water. So I was already crying. And then I'm listening to Pastor Brian and the whole world disappeared, and I'm in this water with my pastor, and then he calls me a sister in Christ. The whole time I was just fighting tears. And somebody's like, \u201cLook, she's just laughing the whole time. It\u2019s fake.\u201d And I was like, man, you know, you're no fun.<\/p><p style=\"\">I don't watch horror movies any more. I just don't want to get scared any more. But some of my favorite movies to this day are about exorcisms. And I reflect on that on in a biblical way. I see demonic possessions, especially in addiction and in the guy who came to my door that night. So when I do watch some of that stuff, I think about my faith, I don't think, \u201cWhoa, this is so great and gory.\u201d People change. I've said some really cringey and awful things in my past interviews that I'm like, \u201cOh, I hope nobody ever looks at it.\u201d Or even the books I've written in the past. I was a 20-year-old dumb kid; that's not who I am any more. And so why would I turn away my friends who know where I stand on things and know that I will always be an open door if they have a question? <\/p><p style=\"\">And so when people say things like, \u201cOh, how could you be friends with them?\u201d It's like, what do you think I should do? Should I just leave this guy with a bad [impression] of Christianity? I'm still gonna love my friends. I have friends who are prostitutes. I have friends who are drug addicts. I have friends who are going through really rough times or, you know, cheating on their spouses. But I have people who go through things and I pray for them just as much.<\/p><p style=\"\">The one person whom I think about through all this is my husband. When we got together, we were both not Christian, and he's really helped me find my way without knowing it. And he's not necessarily on the same page, but he is very supportive. We go to church together every Sunday. But there's parts of him that are still questioning. Hopefully one day he can come to me and say, hey, I've given my heart to Jesus. That hasn't happened yet. And when you have an entire community of people attacking you, it turns people off.<\/p><p style=\"\">If these [critics] genuinely cared about me or my husband, instead of picking us apart, I would hope that they would just pray for us instead. When you look at people, you just don't understand what they\u2019re going through. I remember tattooing a man who accidentally killed his only son. He got a portrait that was paying homage, and it's like, how are you still here? I remember that day; I was pulling out of my tattoo shop and I saw him bandaged up and crossing the street to go back to his car. And I'm at the stoplight, and he's just passing people, and the people who are passing him have no idea what this man is carrying right now. We just treat each other so poorly all the time.<\/p><p style=\"\">I'm not going to dress [differently]. Nothing\u2019s changing in that department. You have no idea how many DMs I got from other goth kids who are in the same boat I was. Saying, \u201cI'm at this crossroad. And I want to go back to church, but I don't have a church to go to,\u201d or \u201cI feel like an outcast even in my own family. I'm trying to make my way back to Jesus.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"\">I don't think I'm a dark person [because] I wear dark clothes. I'm not scared of death. I talk about it all the time. I\u2019ve tattooed portraits of dead people [for] their loved ones for decades. I've read every grieving book, every bereavement book, and I think death is something we should be able to talk about. When I see a skull, I don't think, \u201cThat's demonic.\u201d But if it triggers you spiritually, then keep scrolling, or don't listen to my music.<\/p><p style=\"\">I was very lucky that I had parents who were Christian. I remember finding myself in very dark moments and intuitively praying. And it's so much more meaningful and real when you fall in love as adult. I'm on fire for Jesus. The more I learn, the more excited I get about things and the more at ease I am about what's happening in this world.<\/p><p style=\"\">I don't plan on talking about it too much. I feel like there are some people who have that gift. And some people can be quiet witnesses. And that's me \u2014 I do better one-on-one with people. If somebody DMs me, or if someone on the street comes up to me, that\u2019s totally cool. But I'm not going to be pounding on everybody's front door.<\/p><p style=\"\">If you would have known my heart and mind before, your mind would be blown. I'm the best wife and the best mother I can be now, because of the changes that I've had. It's like a deprogramming that has taken place. My life before, I would have just been like this career boss babe or whatever it is that they call them. I have no interest in that any more. I love to be creative. And I love to have ideas and make them come to life with my mind and my hands. But my priorities have shifted.<\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"10f8ebe7bac7561ca818989882268f83\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vNNSM3r5S2I?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        \n        \n        <\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

        "title": "Jezebel and the demise of \u2018hot mess feminism\u2019",
        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/image.jpg?id=50514767&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C222\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\tIn a bizarrely ahistorical but otherwise engaging <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/nov\/11\/jezebel-shutting-down-feminism\" target=\"_blank\">article<\/a><\/u> for the Guardian, Moira Donegan eulogized the now-defunct website Jezebel, which shut down last week.\n<\/p><p>\n\tFor Donegan, Jezebel was <em>re-radicalizing<\/em>: a desperately needed revival of feminism, restyled for the Information Age. In Donegan\u2019s eyes, Jezebel\u2019s sensationalist first-person essays, known at the time as \u201cclickbait,\u201d were tantamount to radical feminist consciousness-raising. Alongside websites such as xoJane and Feministing, Jezebel showed a strong commitment to woman-first politics and ushered in a new age of feminism.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOr so Donegan claims. With its death, she writes, we are witnessing the end of feminist media itself.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt would be compelling if only it were true.\n<\/p><p>\n\tLike its peers, Jezebel wasn\u2019t exactly the beacon of activism Donegan seems to remember it as. Jezebel was the corporatization of something we\u2019d already seen in the blogosphere. Finally, the feminist websites we\u2019d already been following on LiveJournal, Xanga, and Blogspot had enough reach to start a <em>real<\/em> conversation.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt was also, infamously, one of the first websites to take advantage of accusing people of being \u201cproblematic,\u201d whether that meant \u201cfatphobic,\u201d \u201ctransphobic,\u201d or just plain old \u201cmisogynistic.\u201d For the longest time that was more a tactic of its notoriously toxic comments section (xoJane\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park, either) than the contributors to the site itself. And while Jezebel is best known, on both the right and the left, for its role in the rise of the most toxic elements of wokeness, that isn\u2019t an entirely fair characterization.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMostly, like other websites at the time, Jezebel\u2019s primary goal was to drive click-through traffic. In fact, it was Gawker Media\u2019s \u201c<u><a href=\"https:\/\/prospect.org\/power\/jezebel-grew\/\" target=\"_blank\">highest generator of page views<\/a><\/u>,\u201d which is saying something if you remember the kind of stuff that Gawker used to publish.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIts writers accomplished this in a number of ways: the Jezebel-to-Twitter pipeline, its vicious comments section, its speculation about the <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jezebel.com\/disney-dudes-dicks-what-your-favorite-princes-look-lik-1621694437\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">penis sizes of various Disney princes<\/a><\/u>, and, of course, its <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jezebel.com\/woman-addicted-to-pregnancy-wont-stop-till-her-pussy-fa-1578426047\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">salacious sex stories<\/a><\/u>. If Jezebel was a pioneer of <u><a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090823044352\/http:\/www.doublex.com\/section\/news-politics\/trouble-jezebel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">outrage bait<\/a> <\/u>\u2014 which indeed it was, and this did not go <u><a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/human-interest\/2010\/07\/how-feminist-blogs-like-jezebel-gin-up-page-views.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unnoticed by feminist critics at the time<\/a><\/u>, either \u2014 it was also a pioneer of \u201chot mess\u201d Millennial feminism. You know, the often woeful oversharing about one\u2019s sex life and vices that became such a staple of the once-popular <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/jia-tolentino\/the-personal-essay-boom-is-over\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confessional essay<\/a><\/u>.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnna Holmes, Jezebel\u2019s founder, euphemistically described this tendency as a \u201c<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/the-weekend-essay\/jezebel-and-the-question-of-womens-anger\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">remarkable new openness<\/a><\/u>.\u201d (It\u2019s also worth noting that Jane Pratt\u2019s Sassy reboot, xoJane, would go on to sprint, with both out-there guest contributors and full-time staff like Cat Marnell, where Jezebel only walked.)\n<\/p><p>\n\tWas this \u201cremarkable new openness\u201d really \u201cfeminist\u201d though? That\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. Is strip-mining not only your own personal life but the personal lives of others for $50 and a chance to kick-start your career as journalist turned personality \u201cfeminist\u201d? You tell me!\n<\/p><p>\n\tI wouldn\u2019t compare it to consciousness-raising, as Donegan did, but maybe that\u2019s what it was. Casting light on the unsavory parts of womanhood so we\u2019d all feel less alone. The ad revenue and 15 minutes of e-fame were added bonuses.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThus, with the confessional essays promoted by Jezebel, we saw the birth of the not-quite-a-journalist culture commenter personality. To me, this will always be Jezebel\u2019s <em>real<\/em> contribution to the world of digital media. Not wokeness.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn a way, the rise of the personality over the journalist \u2014 the personalities who were uniquely attention-grabbing and not known for their mastery of the craft or uniqueness of their stories, like Tom Wolfe \u2014 is what killed sites like Jezebel and let social media thrive. It\u2019s not just that the tone of their writing was uniquely Millennial. The way people consume media has changed, too.\n<\/p><p>\n\t<em>Some<\/em> websites have persisted, like the one you\u2019re reading now. But we\u2019re one of the lucky ones. Gen Z isn\u2019t going to blogs in the same way that Millennial readers once did. They\u2019re coasting off vibes from platforms like TikTok and Instagram, picking up ideas from a confluence of different people and sources, or they have a handful of individual personalities they subscribe to.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnd they no longer want \u2014 or need \u2014 a middleman. Or, in the case of Jezebel, a middle woman.\n<\/p>",

The IRS permits you to roll money from your traditional IRA to an HSA, tax-free, up to your contribution limit for the year.<\/p>\n<p>With a traditional IRA, your distribution is taxed even if you\u2019re using the money for medical expenses.

But that same $10,000 distribution costs you $2,400 in taxes if you have more income and fall in the 24% tax bracket.<\/p>\n<p>During years that you have more taxable income \u2014 such as when you sell stocks that generate large capital gains \u2014 minimize your distributions from pretax accounts.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gallery-item\">\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_gobankingrates_57\/04128c8f281c612a40a513458bb12db8\" data-uuid=\"eb1bc7c0-5034-3ff6-8e7a-746545309e4e\"><figcaption>\u00a9Shutterstock.com<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Make Charitable Contributions From RMDs<\/h2>\n<p>If you make charitable contributions during the year and you\u2019re over 70.5 years old, you can use your required minimum distributions from a traditional IRA to make the donations.

Similarly, state and local bonds, or municipal bonds, are exempt from federal income taxes and sometimes state and local taxes, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Just keep in mind that tax-free bonds often pay a lower interest rate than taxable bonds.

This issue gave rise to a tax-reduction strategy known as tax-loss harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, the idea is that in years when you have higher income, you sell investments that have not done so well to offset some or all of that income and lower your tax bill.

Not only does this mean more money stays in your bank account, but it also means you have less taxable income \u2014 and therefore, lower taxes. Also, you\u2019ll want to make sure your retirement accounts are with brokers that aren\u2019t gouging you in fees.<\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<\/p><p><strong>More From GOBankingRates<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/money\/finance\/comfortable-retirement-cost-state\/?utm_term=incontent_link_3&amp;utm_campaign=1252460&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\"><strong>What a Comfortable Retirement Will Cost You in Each State<\/strong><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/saving-money\/car\/these-cars-could-drain-your-savings-through-constant-repairs\/?packet%5Bsession%5D=4ab10533-f271-46b7-927b-4d130c048fd6&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_4&amp;utm_campaign=1252460&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=11&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\"><strong>These 10 Cars Could Drain Your Savings Through Constant Repairs<\/strong><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/top-alternative-investments-1270486\/?utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_term=incontent_link_5&amp;utm_campaign=1252460&amp;utm_content=12&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000<\/strong><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/saving-money\/shopping\/ways-to-squeeze-absolute-most-out-of-average-salary\/?utm_term=incontent_link_6&amp;utm_campaign=1252460&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=13&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\"><strong>7 Ways To Squeeze the Absolute Most Out of an Average Salary<\/strong><\/a><\/li><\/ul><!-- \/wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n<\/div><p>This article originally appeared on\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com?utm_term=incontent_link_7&amp;utm_campaign=1252460&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=14&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">GOBankingRates.com<\/a>:\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/retirement\/planning\/genius-ways-to-reduce-your-retirement-taxes\/?utm_term=incontent_link_8&amp;utm_campaign=1252460&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=15&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">10 Genius Ways To Reduce Your Retirement Taxes<\/a><\/p>\n                    ",

When a security guard barred their entry, they attacked him, slicing through his fingers.<\/p>\n<p>One witness told Le Parisien: \u201cThere was a fight between the assailants and those who were brave enough to face them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a bloodbath,\u201d said another. \u201cYouths from the suburbs surrounded the party hall, blindly stabbing people ... One youth received a heart massage on the floor. It was chaos.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Stabbed several times in the throat<\/h2>\n<p>In the commotion, two men aged 23 and 28 were seriously injured and later hospitalised in a \u201ccritical\u201d condition. One had been stabbed several times in the throat. A third injured individual was in a stable condition on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>One teenager, known only as Thomas, a 16-year-old and keen rugby player, was fatally stabbed.<\/p>\n<p>Hugo, a witness, told Le Parisien: \u201cI was at the entrance and I saw Thomas get stabbed in the heart and throat. A helicopter took him to Lyon but it was sadly too late.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Martine Lagut, the mayor, said the town was \u201ctraumatised\u201d by the apparently unprovoked attack.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA gang turned up to kill,\u201d she told Le Dauphin\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 newspaper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t come to have fun but to harm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Laurent de Caigny, prosecutor of Valence, said police suspected they came to \u201csettle a score\u201d with a person present that night, without providing more details.<\/p>\n<p>An investigation into \u201cmurder and attempted murder by an organised gang\u201d has been launched.<\/p>\n<p>Denouncing a \u201cbarbaric and tragic\u201d act, RC Romans-P\u00e9age, the rugby club for whom Thomas played, posted a photo of the slain teenager on its website in which he smiles with his rugby kit on.<\/p>\n<p>One neighbour told Sud Ouest: \u201cI am totally devastated.

It\u2019s called savagery.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He added: \u201cIt is a general failure of our society.

        "description": "\n                        <p>A celebrated Colombian designer accused of shipping luxury handbags made of exotic reptile skins to the United States has pleaded guilty to a smuggling indictment rather than make a plea deal because her defense lawyer says U.S. prosecutors would not agree with her version of the evidence.<\/p>\n<p>Nancy Teresa Gonzalez de Barberi, who sold her bags for more than $2,000 each to the likes of Britney Spears, Salma Hayek and Victoria Beckham, will argue at her sentencing in February that the merchandise her company sent to high-end New York retailers was made with skins from farm-raised reptiles such as caiman and python, not from protected wildlife species \u2014 contrary to the prosecutors\u2019 view of the evidence.<\/p>\n<p>Gonzalez, 70, who pleaded guilty Friday in Miami federal court to conspiracy and smuggling charges, will present her side of the case before U.S. District Judge Robert Scola in the hope of obtaining a sentence below the federal guideline range of five years in prison.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNancy Gonzalez pleaded guilty directly to her judge rather than negotiate with prosecutors,\u201d defense attorney Sam Rabin said Monday. \u201cThey took the equivalent of an elephant gun to a mosquito when a fly swatter would have sufficed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHer crime was not obtaining the proper paperwork for some samples so she could meet deadlines to get her goods to buyer\u2019s shows\u201d in New York, Rabin said. \u201cAll of the purses that were sold in retail stores were properly documented. Less than 1% of her purses were imported without documentation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At her plea hearing in Miami federal court, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and Justice Department disagreed, saying Gonzalez illegally imported merchandise made with the skins of endangered caiman and python species by using couriers to carry hundreds of her handbags without proper permits or declarations through international airports in Miami and New York, citing the indictment filed in South Florida.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_miami_herald_mcclatchy_670\/f5c0f029da0c188a855042412791810a\" data-uuid=\"3a2d5120-d7e6-3e13-9a0c-416318b4bfb4\"><figcaption>Handbag designer Nancy Gonzalez is pictured in 2008 autographing one of her bags at the Neiman Marcus store in Bal Harbour.

MIAMI HERALD STAFF<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>In the indictment, prosecutors present a very different picture of the designer and her handbag business, whose products go by the brand name \u201cNancy Gonzalez.\u201d She is charged along with her New York-based company, Gzuniga Ltd., and two employees who worked for her Colombian manufacturing firm. Diego Mauricio Rodriguez Giraldo, who remains in custody, pleaded not guilty. He is is scheduled to change that plea to guilty at a hearing set for Nov. 28. Another defendant, John Camilo Aguilar Jarmillo, is at large.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.miamiherald.com\/news\/nation-world\/article279215249.html\" target=\"_self\">The indictment accuses Gonzalez, her U.S. firm, Gzuniga, and the other two defendants<\/a> of soliciting friends, relatives and employees of her manufacturing company in Colombia to act as couriers and transport hundreds of designer handbags on themselves or in their luggage while traveling on passenger airlines to Miami International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport between February 2016 and April 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Another one of Gonzalez\u2019s employees, Paola Soto, played a central role as a courier, according to prosecutors. She pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and smuggling charges and received an initial prison sentence of 2 1\/2 years under a plea agreement with prosecutors Tom Watts-FitzGerald and R.J. Powers. But her punishment was reduced to about nine months after she cooperated as a witness against Gonzalez and the other defendants. <\/p>\n<p>Another employee, Eric Schneider, general manager of the Gzuniga showroom in Manhattan, also pleaded guilty last year to a misdemeanor charge and awaits sentencing as he cooperates with prosecutors. He\u2019s been convicted of \u201cknowingly\u201d selling about 1,000 caiman-skin designer handbags and clutches that were made from endangered species and illegally imported from Colombia. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce the designer handbags were smuggled into the United States, they were delivered or shipped to the Gzuniga showroom in Manhattan, New York, where they were put on display for high-end retailers to view and purchase for re-sale in their stores,\u201d says a news release issued by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami. \u201cThe average retail price for these \u2018Nancy Gonzalez\u2019 brand handbags was over $2,000.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Colombian\u2019s creative purses were sold at Bloomingdale\u2019s, Neiman Marcus and other upscale department stores. They were also clutched by characters on HBO\u2019s hit series, \u201cSex in the City,\u201d set in the very New York borough, Manhattan, where Gonzalez made her first big splash.<\/p>\n<p>Gonzalez was arrested in her native country and spent months behind bars before her extradition from Colombia to the United States in September. She was granted a $750,000 bond by a magistrate judge in Miami federal court under a joint recommendation by her defense attorney and federal prosecutors. Gonzalez, who initially pleaded not guilty, changed her plea to guilty on Friday before Judge Scola. Her former company also pleaded guilty and faces fines up to $500,000.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe actions taken by the government resulted in Ms. Gonzalez being unnecessarily incarcerated in Colombia with drug dealers and terrorists for more than one year while awaiting extradition to the United States, being put out of business and her hundreds of employees becoming unemployed,\u201d Rabin told the Miami Herald.<\/p>\n                    ",

Will it materialize in 2024, at the worst possible moment for President Joe Biden, as he\u2019s trying to convince voters to give him a second term?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not looking that way. As economists roll out their forecasts for 2024, the prevailing theme is moderation: slowing but still-positive economic growth, a declining rate of inflation, and continued low unemployment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe do not expect recessions in most of the key economies of the world,\u201d Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said during a recent briefing on the firm\u2019s 2024 outlook. \u201cA year ago, coming into 2023, we thought there was more of a risk. Some of that was the potential that we actually did need a recession in order to get inflation down. Now, I think that risk is largely behind us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Goldman puts the risk of a recession during the next year at 15%, which is roughly the historical risk of recession in any given year. That\u2019s down from 35% recession odds coming into 2023. Goldman forecasts <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goldmansachs.com\/intelligence\/pages\/2024-us-economic-outlook-final-descent.html\">US GDP growth of 2.1% in 2024<\/a>, just a tad slower than the 2.4% it expects for 2023, with inflation falling from the current 3.2% to around 2.5% \u2014 close to the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%.<\/p>\n<p>Other forecasters are less bullish than Goldman, but most expect a benign combination of positive GDP growth and falling inflation. Oxford Economics, for instance, recently removed a mild recession from its 2024 forecast, because inflation has fallen rapidly since peaking in 2022, without harming employment. \u201cWhile we no longer forecast a recession, we do expect a period of sustained below-trend growth throughout 2024,\u201d Oxford wrote in a Nov. 20 analysis.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_yahoo_finance_433\/1daf3244d367f4944f873ee5d9dd7c6a\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2023-11\/c127c260-87db-11ee-a7fd-3e3c9109e8de\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3000px;\" alt=\"President Joe Biden exits Air Force One as he arrives Norfolk, Va., Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.

Around this time last year, a majority of economists <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-11-15\/economists-revise-up-us-inflation-forecasts-in-bloomberg-survey?sref=eeq6exxF\">surveyed by Bloomberg<\/a> thought there would be a recession within 12 months. Bloomberg\u2019s own forecasting model said there was a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/no-doubt-bloomberg-economists-now-200000007.html\">100% chance of recession<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The reasoning was straightforward. The Federal Reserve was aggressively hiking interest rates to bring inflation down \u2014 and every prior time it did that, a recession occurred, as costlier borrowing dented spending and caused an economic contraction. The Fed even suggested it would tolerate a recession if that\u2019s what it took to tame inflation.<\/p>\n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"mailto:rnewman@yahoofinance.com\"><strong><em>Drop Rick Newman a note<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>, <\/em><\/strong><a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rickjnewman\"><strong><em>follow him on Twitter<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>, or <\/em><\/strong><a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/authory.com\/RickNewman\"><strong><em>sign up for his newsletter<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Economists respect historical precedent and are loath to say this time is different. But this time does seem different. Instead of a recession, the Fed seems increasingly likely to execute a \u201csoft landing\u201d: bringing inflation down without forcing unemployment up. American consumers surprised nearly everybody this year with their willingness to keep spending, even as COVID-era stimulus ran out and excess savings that piled up during the pandemic dwindled. Businesses have held on to workers, even with declining profits. Third quarter real GDP growth was a blockbuster 4.9% and growth for the year should be about 2 percentage points above the consensus forecast from a year ago.<\/p>\n<p>Real income, adjusted for inflation, was negative for Biden\u2019s first two years in office, which means inflation outpaced earnings growth and the typical family fell behind. But real income growth flipped to positive earlier this year and wages now seem to be growing enough to sustain modest spending growth. Surprises are always possible \u2014 war, another pandemic, an energy price shock \u2014 but the fundamentals are in place for a normalish economy in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for Biden\u2019s reelection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Biden is relatively unpopular, with a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/other\/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html\">weak 40% approval rating<\/a>, and an even smaller portion of voters who <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/other\/president_biden_job_approval_economy-7321.html\">approve of his handling of the economy<\/a>. High inflation has been Biden\u2019s biggest economic problem, but Biden\u2019s approval rating has not improved as the inflation rate has dropped by nearly 6 percentage points. Voters seem scarred by the alarming price hikes of 2021 and 2022, and unwilling to forgive Biden or forget the damage done to their wallets.<\/p>\n<p>The state of the economy three to six months prior to Election Day often determines whether an incumbent president earns reelection. Incumbents typically win if there\u2019s no recession and lose if there is one. So by that logic, a solid economy next year should favor Biden\u2019s reelection. Yet polls show him <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/campaign\/4318846-trump-expands-lead-over-biden-in-2024-match-up-poll\/\">close with Donald Trump<\/a>, his likely Republican challenger, and even <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/11\/05\/us\/politics\/biden-trump-2024-poll.html\">losing in some swing states<\/a> that will be pivotal to next year\u2019s outcome.<\/p>\n<p>Three things could happen. Voters could come around and start giving Biden more credit for a healthy economy. Or the economy could surprise to the downside, and enter the recession gloomy consumers think is on the way. Or the economy could continue growing, with inflation dropping, and the electorate could vote Biden out anyway.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Maybe this time really is different.<\/p>\n<p><em>Rick Newman is a senior columnist for <\/em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/author\/rick-newman\/?.tsrc=fin-srch\"><em>Yahoo Finance<\/em><\/a><em>.

        "description": "\n                        <p>Gaza\u2019s largest hospital,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/middleeast\/live-news\/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-17-23\/h_5547eb1cd0fbde8f465f98e576794db9?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\">Al-Shifa<\/a>, has become a flashpoint in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, which began when gunmen from the militant group crossed the border into Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people.<\/p>\n<p>Palestinians and humanitarian agencies say the current fighting in and around Al-Shifa is proof of Israel\u2019s wanton disregard for civilian life in Gaza, while Israel accuses Hamas of using the medical center as a shield for its operations. On top of providing medical care, the Al-Shifa Hospital had recently become a key shelter for thousands of Palestinian civilians fleeing Israeli bombardment.<\/p>\n<p>Since launching its operation at the hospital on November 15, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have shown images of a tunnel shaft and military equipment, but have yet to show conclusive proof of the large-scale command and control center it alleges is there.<\/p>\n<p>Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry and hospital officials have denied Israel\u2019s claims, saying that hospitals in the Strip have only been used to treat patients. Doctors in Al-Shifa have also sounded the alarm about deteriorating conditions inside the medical facility, which is struggling to meet patients\u2019 needs amid supply shortages and the presence of Israeli troops.<\/p>\n<p>The IDF is now under pressure to prove Israel\u2019s long-standing assertion with its promise of \u201cconcrete evidence.\u201d Its ability to continue its operation in Gaza, and the credibility of Israel, could be at stake as the number killed in Gaza surpasses 12,000, according to authorities in the Hamas-controlled Strip.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what we know so far.<\/p>\n<h3>What does Israel say?<\/h3>\n<p>For weeks, the IDF said Hamas has been using Gaza\u2019s largest hospital as cover for what it calls terror infrastructure below ground. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Hamas had a command and control center or headquarters underneath the hospital complex grounds, which other senior Israeli officials have also insisted on.<\/p>\n<p>In a presentation to the media last month, Hagari claimed that Hamas was directing rocket attacks and commanding operations from bunkers underneath the hospital building, which he said were linked to a network of tunnels that Hamas had dug underneath Gaza City.<\/p>\n<p>The IDF also published an \u201cintelligence-based\u201d illustrated video of what it claims the Hamas headquarters under Al-Shifa looks like. The video shows a 3D diagram of the hospital, which moves to show an animated network of purported tunnels and operation rooms.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Premature babies which were evacuated from an incubator in Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City to receive treatment at a hospital in Rafah, in southern Gaza, on November 19. - Hatem Khaled\/Reuters\" height=\"540\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_cnn_articles_945\/ea98436d42ca2ae981e73078820d781a\" width=\"960\" data-uuid=\"b707499f-cab6-3819-974d-21f0eb329bbc\"><figcaption>Premature babies which were evacuated from an incubator in Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City to receive treatment at a hospital in Rafah, in southern Gaza, on November 19. - Hatem Khaled\/Reuters<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>CNN cannot independently verify Israel\u2019s claims that Hamas is operating a \u201ccommand and control center\u201d from the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>The White House has backed Israel\u2019s claims, saying that Hamas was storing weapons and operating a command node from Al-Shifa, citing US intelligence. But senior US officials have declined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/middleeast\/live-news\/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-14-23\/h_33ff84e2aa68df5bad1dc819806333b7?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\">multiple times<\/a> to expand on how they can corroborate Israel\u2019s claims, as the US does not have a presence on the ground in Gaza.<\/p>\n<h3>What evidence has Israel provided?<\/h3>\n<p>Over the weekend, the IDF took CNN and other news organizations to a newly exposed tunnel shaft on the grounds of the Al-Shifa hospital complex that it says was used by Hamas.<\/p>\n<p>The structure appeared to be substantial, with the remains of a ladder hanging over the opening and a pole that looked like a hub for a spiral staircase running through the middle of the shaft.<\/p>\n<p>The IDF also released video \u2013 filmed on Friday \u2013 from inside the shaft, showing a staircase leading down into a concrete tunnel that the military said was 55 meters long and located 10 meters underground. At the end of the tunnel is a metal door with a small window, according to the video, which the IDF said it had not yet opened to the possibility that Hamas had booby-trapped it.<\/p>\n<p>The video is arguably the most compelling evidence thus far that the IDF has offered that there may be a network of tunnels below the hospital. It does not, however, establish without a doubt that there is a command center under Al-Shifa.<\/p>\n<p>The Israeli military on Sunday also presented several videos that it said illustrated Hamas\u2019 presence at Al-Shifa hospital, including CCTV footage that appeared to show hostages being brought through the hospital itself and separate footage from inside a tunnel shaft on the medical compound\u2019s grounds. CNN cannot independently verify the content of the videos.<\/p>\n<p>The CCTV footage showed Hamas fighters moving a Nepalese hostage and a Thai hostage through the hospital on October 7, IDF spokesperson Hagari said. One appears to be frog-marched through the building, while another appears to be bleeding and is pushed on a gurney.<\/p>\n<p>Hagari did not spell out how the IDF had acquired the videos, though he did say that Israeli intelligence officers were part of the operation inside the hospital to try to locate the hostages.<\/p>\n<p>Hagari also dismissed suggestions that the hostages had been brought to the hospital because they were wounded, claiming that one of the two hostages in the videos was not injured and did not need medical treatment. They had been brought to the hospital first before being moved to hiding spots like nearby apartments, he said.<\/p>\n<p>The shared CCTV footage comes after Israel\u2019s military said it found the bodies of two Israeli hostages \u2013 a 65-year-old woman and an Israeli soldier \u2013 in the same neighborhood as Al-Shifa hospital.<\/p>\n<p>The IDF had previously touted other alleged discoveries on the hospital grounds, saying soldiers located a room in Al-Shifa where they found \u201ctechnological assets, along with military and combat equipment used by Hamas\u201d for \u201cterrorist purposes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hamas has rejected those claims as \u201cbaseless lies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>CNN analysis of separate footage published online by the IDF prior to visits from international media outlets&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/middleeast\/live-news\/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-11-18-23\/h_1d70c190adde686e6a2b59e963499e82?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\">suggests weaponry at Al-Shifa<\/a>&nbsp;may have been rearranged.<\/p>\n<p>An IDF video on November 15 showed a military spokesperson touring the facility, during which an AK-47 gun is seen behind an MRI machine. Fox News and the BBC were subsequently granted access to the hospital. In their reports filmed after the IDF clip, two AK-47 guns are visible in the same location. It is unclear where the second assault rifle came from.<\/p>\n<p>The IDF told CNN the discrepancy between the military\u2019s own video and the BBC footage was \u201cdue to the fact that more weaponry and terrorist assets were discovered throughout the day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSuggestions that the IDF is manipulating the media are incorrect,\u201d it said.<\/p>\n<p>The United Nations has called for access to the site for an independent investigation into the competing allegations and warned that hospitals should not be used as battlegrounds for any side.<\/p>\n<h3>How has Hamas responded?<\/h3>\n<p>Israel\u2019s allegations have been vehemently denied by Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry, and hospital officials.<\/p>\n<p>The director general of the Hamas-controlled health ministry, Dr. Medhat Abbas, told CNN that hospitals in the enclave \u201care used to treat patients only\u201d and are not being used \u201cto hide anyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The health ministry responded to the images of hostages inside Al-Shifa released Sunday by the IDF by questioning their authenticity \u2013 but went on to say that if true, the pictures showed that hospitals in Gaza provided medical care to anyone who needed it.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement issued Saturday before the release of the CCTV videos, Hamas said it had brought several hostages to hospitals for medical treatment after they were injured in Israeli air strikes.<\/p>\n<p>After Israel launched its operation, Hamas accused the US of giving Israel \u201ca green light \u2026 to commit more massacres against civilians\u201d by amplifying what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that a militant command center lies somewhere inside Al-Shifa.<\/p>\n<h3>Why Al-Shifa matters and what\u2019s happening to its patients<\/h3>\n<p>More than five days since the IDF raided Al-Shifa hospital, Israeli troops are still on hospital grounds, and the facility is still filled with patients and medical staff operating in dire humanitarian circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Doctors who are still at the hospital cannot treat patients due to heavy shelling in the past week.

The package also includes another High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS.<\/p>\n<p>Austin said Ukraine&#39;s effort to defeat Russian forces \u201cmatters to the rest of the world&quot; and that U.S. support would continue \u201cfor the long haul.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Zelenskyy said Austin&#39;s visit was \u201ca very important signal&quot; for Ukraine. \u201cWe count on your support,\u201c Zelenskyy said, thanking Congress as well as the American people for their backing.<\/p>\n<p>This is Austin\u2019s second trip to Kyiv since Russia&#39;s 2022 invasion, but he\u2019s making it under far different circumstances, as the world\u2019s attention is drawn to the Middle East and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/ukraine-russia-war-fatigue-gaza-hamas-israel-94b6351b05178078dddc027f188526b3\">signs of fatigue<\/a> set in with the almost 21-month Russia-Ukraine <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine\">war<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/russia-ukraine-biden-kyiv-lloyd-austin-europe-3a8441a7b10c5786fe5fd7f841332697\">Austin&#39;s first visit<\/a> occurred in April 2022, just two months after the start of the war. At the time, Ukraine was riding a wave of global rage at <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine\">Moscow\u2019s invasion<\/a>, and Austin launched an international effort that now sees 50 countries meet monthly to coordinate on what weapons, training and other support could be pushed to Kyiv.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But the conflict in Gaza could <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/israel-ukraine-congress-senate-austin-blinken-a56354873731af2ea5a96db227059969\">pull attention and resources<\/a> from the Ukraine fight. The U.S. has worked feverishly since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, and the weeks of devastating bombardment on Gaza by Israel that has followed, to prevent the conflict from turning into a regional war. Even as Austin stood in St. Michael&#39;s Square in Kyiv, the first question asked at a press briefing at the end of the short visit was about Israel\u2019s use of U.S.-provided weapons in that conflict, instead of about Ukraine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Both conflicts have already seen significant U.S. military support. To back Israel and keep that conflict from spreading, the U.S. has already committed two carrier strike groups, scores of fighter jets and thousands of U.S. personnel to the Middle East, and has had to shift its force posture and conduct airstrikes against Iranian-backed militant groups that are now hitting U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria on a regular basis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For Ukraine, the U.S. has already provided more than $44 billion \u2014 and allies have sent an additional $35 billion \u2014 in weapons packages that range from millions of bullets to air defense systems, advanced European and U.S. battle tanks and, finally, pledges for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/romania-nato-ukraine-f16-russia-training-914515e10846720036e9a9c709df2a85\">F-16 fighter jets<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>But Ukraine still needs more, and after almost 20 months of shipping arms to Ukraine, cracks are beginning to show. Some European countries such as Poland have <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/poland-ukraine-weapons-russia-war-trade-dispute-5e2e7a194b5238b86c160f0f4848b4f3\">scaled back support,<\/a> noting their need to maintain adequate fighting ability to defend themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ukrainian officials have strongly pushed back on suggestions they are in a stalemate with Russia after a long-awaited counteroffensive over the summer did not radically change the battle lines on the ground. In a visit to Washington last week, Andriy Yermak, head of the president\u2019s office, provided no details but confirmed that Ukrainian forces had <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/russia-ukraine-war-dnieper-river-kherson-7d1fe4cfa8b748e6736c9f2b620ff618\">finally pushed through<\/a> to the east bank of the Dnieper River, which has essentially served as the immovable front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces for months.<\/p>\n<p>However, as winter sets in it will become more difficult for either side to make large gains due to ground conditions. That could further work against Ukraine if U.S. lawmakers perceive there\u2019s time to wait before more funds are needed. Ukraine and the U.S. expect that this winter Russia will go after Ukraine&#39;s infrastructure again, like the power grid, making air defenses critical.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fred Kagan, a senior resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said it would be a mistake to think there is time to wait.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf we stop providing aid to Ukraine, it\u2019s not that the stalemate continues. The aid is actually essential to preventing the Russians from beginning to maneuver again in ways that can allow them to defeat Ukraine,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cSo the cost of cutting off aid is that Russia wins and Ukraine loses and NATO loses.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Further complicating the support is that the Pentagon has only a dwindling amount of money left in this year\u2019s budget to keep sending weapons to Ukraine, and Congress is months late on getting a new budget passed and has not taken up a supplemental spending package that would include Ukraine aid.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Since the war began in February 2022, the U.S. has provided more than $44.2 billion in weapons to Ukraine, but the funding is nearly gone. The Pentagon can send about $5 billion more in weapons and equipment from its own stocks. But it only has about $1 billion in funding to replace those stocks. As a result, recent announcements of weapons support have been of much smaller dollar amounts, such as the $100 million package announced in Kyiv by Austin, than in months past.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have seen smaller packages, because we need to parse these out,\u201d Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Thursday. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t know when Congress is going to pass our supplemental package.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Officials have been urging Congress to provide additional money, but a growing number of Senate Republicans have opposed additional Ukraine aid without securing support for other unrelated provisions, such as stricter immigration laws and additional funding for border control. A stopgap spending bill passed last week to avoid a government shutdown during the holidays did not include any money for Ukraine. ___<\/p>\n<p>Copp reported from Washington.<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine: <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine\">https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/russia-ukraine<\/a><\/p>\n                    ",

More civilian hostage releases could potentially follow.<\/p><p>At this stage, there is no firm deal in hand but rather a written draft agreement that is being passed between parties who remain locked in what were described to CBS News as very difficult talks brokered with the help of the <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/william-burns-doha-amid-israel-hamas-conflict-hostages\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. and Qatar<\/a><\/span>, according to two sources familiar.<\/p><p>In an interview with &quot;Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,&quot; White House deputy national security advisor Jon Finer <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/israel-hamas-hostage-release-deal-jon-finer-face-the-nation\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\">said that<\/a><\/span> &quot;many areas of difference that previously existed&quot; in the hostage talks &quot;have been narrowed,&quot; and that the U.S. is &quot;closer than we have been to reaching a final agreement.&quot;<\/p><p>Finer said it would not be helpful to detail the developing diplomacy in public, and acknowledged the caveat that past deals had been close before collapsing. Hopes were high last week that a breakthrough in diplomacy was finally imminent, but two officials in the region cited the Israeli military move on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/video\/al-shifa-hospital-caught-in-crossfire-in-gaza\/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" rel=\"nofollow\">al-Shifa hospital<\/a> as having complicated diplomacy with Hamas.<\/p><p>A source familiar with the draft agreement told CBS News that the proposal as it stands now would involve 50 hostages being released on day one with a limited pause in fighting that would last around four days for a duration of six hours a day. If that release and pause happens as planned, there would be a second release of around 20-25 hostages, according to this source. White House officials declined to comment on the sensitive diplomacy.<\/p><p>In a press conference on Sunday in Doha, Qatar&#39;s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani described the remaining sticking points to the emerging deal between Israel and Hamas as &quot;very minor&quot; logistical matters and said the parties are &quot;close to reaching an agreement.&quot;<\/p><span class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani speaks during a press conference with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borell, in Doha on November 19, 2023. \/ Credit: AFP via Getty Images\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_cbs_news_articles_189\/b0d3dea0624952653a9ec3228f5e7a88\" data-uuid=\"897e19c7-892f-314e-bd33-36507f0bec83\"><\/span><p>Sources familiar with the talks have said there are several recent complicating issues, including whether overhead surveillance would happen during the releases. Israel has also demanded that Hamas provide some accounting for the captives it holds or can obtain from other militant groups such as Islamic Jihad, as the total figure of more than 200 hostages remains just an estimate.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Last week, two of those unaccounted for who were believed to have been hostages, Noa Marciano and Yehudit Weiss, were&nbsp;<span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/israel-says-second-hostage-noa-marciano-found-dead-near-gazas-al-shifa-hospital\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\">found dead<\/a><\/span>&nbsp;by the IDF nearby the 45,00-square-meter al-Shifa hospital complex in Gaza. The remains of those slaughtered by the terror group Hamas and other militants during the Oct. 7&nbsp; attack in Israel continue to be identified.<\/p><p>&quot;Obviously, Gaza is an extremely dangerous place to be a civilian, to be a hostage held at this point,&quot; Finer told CBS&#39; Margaret Brennan, &quot;so there is a time imperative.&quot;<\/p><p>Finer said he wouldn&#39;t use the phrase &quot;running out of time,&quot; but &quot;we feel acutely that this should be done as soon as possible.&quot;<\/p><p>Moussa Abu Marzouk, a founding member of Hamas and a senior figure in its political wing, told CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams on Monday in Doha, Qatar, that the two sides were &quot;close&quot; to reaching an agreement that would see his group release 50 hostages in exchange for a five-day cease-fire \u2014 and the release of 100 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.<\/p><p>He said Israel would also cease all flight operations over the southern portion of Gaza during the temporary cease-fire, and for six hours daily in the northern part of the enclave to enable the transfer of hostages and the provision of humanitarian aid supplies.<\/p><p>Marzouk&#39;s description of the prospective agreement differed notably from what other officials involved in the talks have spoken of, primarily for its inclusion of the release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. He said all 100 of the Palestinians in question were women, children and the elderly currently in Israeli prisons.<\/p><p>Marzouk acknowledged that Hamas could not account for the location or condition of all of the Israeli hostages in Gaza, and he reiterated the group&#39;s claim that some \u2014 &quot;maybe around 60&quot; \u2014 had been killed by Israel&#39;s ongoing bombardment of the densely-populated enclave.<\/p><p>Others, he said, could be captives of other Palestinian militant groups or even be in the homes of Palestinian families.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&quot;Nobody can search about this,&quot; the Hamas official told CBS News. &quot;It&#39;s a war.&quot;<\/p><p>Officials have told CBS News that one of the complications of the ongoing talks in Doha is the time it can take for information to be relayed between Hamas officials there and their military counterparts in Gaza. Some sources have said there can be a delay of two to three days between officials in Doha agreeing to something and Hamas&#39; commanders in Gaza either confirming or rejecting the proposal, for instance.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-hostages-gaza-al-shifa-hospital\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\">told CBS News&#39;<\/a><\/span> Norah O&#39;Donnell last week that Israel had &quot;strong indications&quot; hostages were held in al-Shifa hospital, which was one of the reasons he cited for the Israeli Defense Forces&#39; decision to enter al-Shifa. However, Netanyahu added &quot;if there were they were taken out.&quot;<\/p><p>The United States has not produced intelligence to confirm the assessment, but did <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/israel-military-ground-operation-al-shifa-hospital-gaza-hamas\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\">issue downgraded intelligence<\/a><\/span> last week that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad members operate a &quot;command and control node&quot; from al-Shifa hospital and tunnels underneath, and have used it for both weapons and hostages.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Finer said the U.S. is still confident in its assessment, and said that the Israeli military is still &quot;exploiting&quot; the al Shifa facility to find further information.&nbsp;<\/p><p>On Saturday in Manama, President Biden&#39;s top Mideast adviser Brett McGurk described the hostage talks as intensive and ongoing before heading to Doha for meetings with the Qatar Prime Minister that night. In public comments, McGurk echoed Israel&#39;s call for the release of a &quot;large number of hostages&quot; in order to lead to a &quot;significant pause in fighting&quot; and what he described as a &quot;massive&quot; surge of humanitarian relief. He acknowledged that one of Hamas&#39; demands has been to receive fuel and humanitarian supplies. McGurk did not make public mention of an <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/israel-hamas-war-negotiations-gaza-cease-fire-deal-for-some-hostages\/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\">earlier request by Hamas<\/a><\/span> for the release of an undetermined number of Palestinian women and children from Israeli detention centers.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&quot;That&#39;s the bargain they set,&quot; McGurk has said from the earliest days. McGurk said the onus remains on Hamas to release all of the hostages \u2014 &quot;the women, the children, the toddlers, the babies, all of them.&quot;<\/p><p>CIA director Bill Burns is back in Washington but has remained involved following his meetings in recent weeks with the Mossad chief. President Biden himself has been working the phones, calling Qatar&#39;s Emir on November 12th and as recently as Friday, an indication that a resolution was near.<\/p><p>Qatar is using its relationship with Hamas to mediate and the U.S. is helping to broker proposals that are passed from a tight circle in Doha to Hamas leaders in Gaza as well as Israel&#39;s five-person war cabinet that is led by Netanyahu.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/steven-van-zandt-60-minutes-video-2023-11-19?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">Steven Van Zandt: The 60 Minutes Interview<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/the-chicago-sandwich-joint-that-inspired-the-bear?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">The Chicago sandwich joint that inspired &quot;The Bear&quot;<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/a-sweet-celebration-of-pawpaw-fruit?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">A sweet celebration of pawpaw fruit<\/a><\/p>\n                    ",

That, apparently, was enough to light a fire under Dallas; less than three minutes of game clock later, Cowboys running back Tony Pollard scored his first touchdown since Week 1 to extend the Dallas lead.\u00a0<\/p><p>And then it turned ugly. On the very next play from scrimmage, cornerback DaRon Bland took advantage of rookie Panthers quarterback Bryce Young, snaring an interception and returning it for a touchdown. Young failed to notice Bland jumping into the passing lane ahead of wide receiver Jonathan Mingo, and 30 yards later, Bland had his NFL record-tying fourth pick 6 of the season.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><figure><img alt=\"Dallas Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland has tied the NFL record for most pick 6s in a single season in NFL history.

The Cowboys swarmed Carolina&#39;s offensive line, sacking Young six times. Micah Parsons had 2.5 of those, and spent almost as much time in Carolina&#39;s backfield as Young himself.\u00a0<\/p><p>Young finished with 123 yards through the air, completing 16 of 29 attempts with one touchdown, one interception and one lost fumble. The Cowboys&#39; Dak Prescott wasn&#39;t exceptional \u2014 189 yards, 25-of-38, two touchdowns \u2014 but he didn&#39;t need to be, not with the defense locking down Young and Bland turning a mistake into a touchdown.<\/p><p>Bland, a fifth-round draft pick in 2022 out of Fresno State, has stepped up in the absence of cornerback Trevon Diggs, who was lost for the season after two games due to a torn ACL.\u00a0<\/p><p>Bland has seven games left to set the pick-6 NFL record, a feat more impressive than even the most fervent Cowboys fans could have expected.\u00a0<\/p><p>Dallas now has to prove it can win against the blue-chip teams on its schedule. After a divisional game against the Commanders on Thanksgiving Day, Dallas will face Seattle, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Miami and Detroit in succession. That five-game stretch to close out 2023 will define the quality of this Cowboys team in a way that a victory over Carolina won&#39;t.\u00a0<\/p>\n                    ",

She is the daughter of Wilburn Edgar Smith, a mechanic, and Allie Murray Smith, a seamstress and postal worker.<\/p><p>Late August 1927: \u201cMiss Lillian\u201d Carter, a neighbor and nurse who delivered Rosalynn, brings her son, Jimmy, nearly 3 years old, to meet the new baby.<\/p><p>1940: Rosalynn&#39;s father dies, leaving her to help her mother raise her younger siblings.<\/p><p>1945: She begins dating Jimmy Carter, now a Naval Academy midshipman and the brother of her close friend, Ruth Carter.<\/p><p>Spring 1946: She graduates from Georgia Southwestern College.<\/p><p>July 7, 1946: She marries Jimmy at Plains Methodist Church, her childhood congregation. They would have four children: John William (\u201cJack\u201d), born 1947; James Earl III (\u201cChip\u201d), 1950; Donnel Jeffrey, 1952; and Amy Lynn, 1967. <\/p><p>1946-1953: Rosalynn manages the Carter household while Jimmy serves in the Navy&#39;s nuclear submarine program, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander.<\/p><p>1955: She begins helping Jimmy in the farm warehouse; she soon \u201cknew more on paper about the business than he did,\u201d she recalled ahead of their 75th anniversary.<\/p><p>1962: She helps Jimmy campaign for state Senate, an office he would win in a contested election that was ultimately settled in court.<\/p><p>1966: Rosalynn begins campaigning on her own for the first time during Jimmy\u2019s first run for Georgia governor, a race he loses. But their model of campaigning separately would be key to winning four years later and to capturing the presidency in 1976.<\/p><p>1975-76: She leads the \u201cPeanut Brigade\u201d of Carter family, friends and supporters from Georgia who spread out across Iowa and other key nominating states to widen the campaign\u2019s person-to-person reach. The same model they used in Georgia revolutionizes presidential campaigning, with Rosalynn as Jimmy\u2019s top surrogate.<\/p><p>Jan. 20, 1977: Rosalynn, the newly sworn-in 39th president and their family draw special attention on Inauguration Day by walking down Pennsylvania Avenue rather than riding in an armored limousine. The Carters enroll daughter Amy in a Washington, D.C., public school that is majority-Black. In Atlanta, when Carter was governor, Amy had attended private school.<\/p><p>Summer 1977: Rosalynn makes a 13-day diplomatic trip to seven Latin American nations and Caribbean islands. She also urges Jimmy to delay action on treaties yielding control of the Panama Canal, arguing it is too politically costly for a first term. He proceeds with the treaties. <\/p><p>September 1978: Rosalynn is with Jimmy at Camp David for much of the intense negotiations with Israel&#39;s Menachem Begin and Egypt&#39;s Anwar Sadat. She listens to and advises the president daily before the three leaders reach the Camp David Accords. Begin and Sadat both warm to the first lady, and Sadat becomes especially close to the Carters. <\/p><p>November 1979: Rosalynn leads a delegation to Cambodian refugee camps, bringing international media attention to the humanitarian crisis. She convinces the president to admit more refugees to the U.S. <\/p><p>Summer and fall 1980: She campaigns nearly daily on Jimmy\u2019s behalf, while he stays at the White House working to win the release of American hostages in Iran.<\/p><p>1980: She helps win congressional approval for the Mental Health Systems Act, dedicating more federal money to local centers for treating mental health; Republican Ronald Reagan would later reverse course as president.<\/p><p>November 1980: Jimmy Carter is denied a second term by Reagan, who wins 51.6 percent of the popular vote to 41.7 percent for Carter and 6.7 percent for independent John Anderson.<\/p><p>1982: The Carters co-found The Carter Center in Atlanta with a mission of resolving conflicts, protecting human rights, advocating democracy and preventing disease around the world.<\/p><p>1984: Rosalynn releases her memoir, \u201cFirst Lady from Plains,\u201d in which she admits to missing Washington. It is the first of her five books.<\/p><p>September 1984: She travels to New York City, where the Carters volunteer building homes for Habitat for Humanity; this would become their annual Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project.<\/p><p>1987: She establishes the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, located at her collegiate alma mater, to advocate for Americans who are unpaid caregivers.<\/p><p>Summer 1989: Rosalynn travels with Jimmy on a weeklong Africa tour that includes an international conference on Guinea worm eradication, perhaps The Carter Center&#39;s most ambitious public health initiative. <\/p><p>1996: She establishes the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, based at The Carter Center, to help working journalists produce better reporting on the topic.<\/p><p>1999: She is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton.<\/p><p>July 10, 2007: She testifies before a U.S. House subcommittee, urging Congress to require that health insurance policies cover mental health treatment on par with treatment for other illness.<\/p><p>November 2016: She hosts the Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy for the 32nd time.<\/p><p>October 2019: In Nashville, the Carters participate in person for the last time in their Habitat for Humanity work project; the program would continue. <\/p><p>April 30, 2021: The Carters receive President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden at their home in Plains. The couples were friends since the 1976 campaign, when Biden, then a young lawmaker from Delaware, became the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter for president.<\/p><p>July 7, 2021: The Carters celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary. Offering advice for a successful marriage, she says, \u201ceach (person) should have some space. That\u2019s really important.\u201d<\/p><p>Feb. 18, 2023: The Carter family announces that Jimmy is entering home hospice care. They would later say they thought he would live only days but rebounded to celebrate their 77th wedding anniversary and his 99th birthday later in the year.<\/p><p>May 30, 2023: The family announces that Rosalynn has dementia.<\/p><p>Sept. 23, 2023: The Carters make a surprise appearance in the Plains Peanut Festival parade, riding in a Secret Service vehicle with the windows down for what would be her last public appearance.<\/p><p>Nov. 17, 2023: The Carter family announces that she has entered home hospice care.<\/p><p>Nov. 19, 2023. Rosalynn Carter dies at home in Plains, Georgia, in the same house where the Carters lived when Jimmy was elected to the state Senate in 1962. <\/p>\n                    ",

This is because they cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat.\u201d<\/p><p>The Tesla CEO\u2019s comments drew comparisons to the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/backgrounder\/great-replacement-explainer\" target=\"_blank\"> a racist conspiracy theory<\/a> that Jewish people are conspiring to replace white people with minority groups.<\/p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of condemnation for singling out a specific religious group during this time of rapidly rising antisemitism,\u201d Tapper said, adding that \u201cyou have been very out front when you see antisemitism on the left. Is antisemitism on the right something that concerns you as well?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cAcross the board,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cAnd, actually, I think, in the advent of these attacks, the amount of antisemitism that we have seen has really surprised me.\u201d<\/p><p>DeSantis said he signed legislation in Florida that he characterized as an effort to combat antisemitism on college campuses \u2014 which has come under fire for its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/florida-sued-ban-palestinian-student-groups-rcna125652\" target=\"_blank\">ban on pro-Palestinian student groups<\/a> \u2014before insisting that antisemitism is seen on \u201cboth sides.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cThe difference is that, on the left, that tends to be attached to some major institutional power, like some of our most august universities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas I think, on the right, it tends to be more fringe voices that are doing it.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s wrong no matter what,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that we have seen antisemitism this bad in the world probably since the Second World War.\u201d<\/p><p>Tapper later mentioned in the interview that he still hadn\u2019t heard DeSantis condemn Musk\u2019s post.<\/p><p>DeSantis again insisted that he hadn\u2019t seen it.<\/p><p>\u201cI know you tried to read it, I have no idea what the context is,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Elon Musk. I have never seen him do anything. I think he\u2019s a guy that believes in America. I have never seen him indulge in any of that. So it\u2019s surprising if that\u2019s true, but I have not seen it. So I don\u2019t want to sit there and pass judgment on the fly.\u201d<\/p><p>Meanwhile, DeSantis\u2019 fellow Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy on Saturday defended the tech mogul. Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur who is friends with Musk,  angrily derided the SpaceX CEO\u2019s critics.<\/p><p>\u201cNow they use the label of antisemitic if you say something that challenges the orthodoxy,\u201d Ramaswamy said while drawing a comparison between the backlash against antisemitism and the social justice movement that swept the nation in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death.<\/p><p>\u201cI think what they\u2019re doing to him is ridiculous. I think it\u2019s crazy to call him antisemitic,\u201d he added.<\/p><p>When NBC News tried to ask him if he agreed with Musk\u2019s antisemitic post, Ramaswamy interjected: \u201cI think the reality is the woke infection from several years ago, which many left-leaning groups like the ADL, have supported, actually planted the seeds for the antisemitism we\u2019re seeing today.\u201d<\/p><p>Moments later, Ramaswamy, who has said he wants<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/meet-the-press\/meetthepressblog\/vivek-ramaswamy-wants-elon-musk-adviser-elected-president-rcna101946\" target=\"_blank\"> Musk as an adviser<\/a> if he is elected president, said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/urldefense.com\/v3\/__https:\/x.com\/VivekGRamaswamy\/status\/1725979586452738486?s=20__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!oic9BwRYMb03KMdIUXP7S2vGwZMKfgkc2DXwLHl9j8tOKC7O2OdqeAMH1zg0VZ_YBR9ObK05afrnRh8HCJlagt6gWBltrME8po5nMPZwLH9ZNw6N$\" target=\"_blank\">post to X<\/a> that there have been \u201cintentional distortions of Elon\u2019s comments.\u201d<\/p><p>Former New Jersey Gov.

The COLA\u2019s steep hike this year is due to the soaring inflation rate, which is also the biggest in 41 years.<\/p>\n<p>The average monthly Social Security payment for all retired workers has risen to an estimated $1,827 from $1,681, the SSA said \u2014 a gain of $146 a month.<\/p>\n<p>For anyone receiving Social Security benefits, the new payment amount started in January 2023.

However, there are also instances when you might have a qualifying disability even if you\u2019re still working, such as if you can\u2019t do work you previously did because of your medical condition. In this case, you are only eligible up to a certain amount of income. When you pass that threshold, you cannot be considered to have a qualifying disability. Following are the threshold changes for 2023, based on average monthly earnings:<\/p>\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><\/td><td><strong>2022<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>2023<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Non-Blind<\/td><td> $1,350\/month <\/td><td> $1,470\/month <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blind<\/td><td> $2,260\/month<\/td><td> $2,460\/month<\/td><\/tr><tr><td> Trial Work Period (TWP) <\/td><td> $970\/month<\/td><td> $1,050\/month<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure><h2>SSI Federal Payment Standard Rises<\/h2>\n<p>Social Security recipients who also qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits have seen an increase in the maximum Federal SSI payment amounts in 2023, based on the 8.7% COLA. For individuals, the standard rose to $914 a month from $841 in 2022. For couples, the payment rose to $1,371 a month in 2023 from $1,261 in 2022.<\/p>\n<h2>Rise in Max Benefits for Workers Retiring at Full Retirement Age<\/h2>\n<p>Americans who retire at full retirement age \u2014 either 66 or 67, depending on when you were born \u2014 saw a bump in their maximum benefits this year. The maximum rose to $3,627 a month in 2023 from $3,345 a month in 2022.<\/p>\n<h2>Maximum Taxable Earnings Will Increase for Those Still Working<\/h2>\n<p>Anyone who has ever received a paycheck knows that part of that check is withheld to pay Social Security taxes. There is a limit on the amount of your annual earnings that can be taxed by Social Security, called the maximum taxable earnings. That limit rose to $160,200 in 2023 from $147,000 in 2022.<\/p>\n<h2>Change to Earnings Test Exempt Amounts<\/h2>\n<p>Social Security withholds benefits if your earnings exceed a certain level and if you are under the full retirement age (FRA). This is called the retirement earnings test exempt amount. According to the SSA, one of two different exempt amounts apply \u2014 a lower amount in years before the year you reach FRA and a higher amount in the year you reach FRA.<\/p>\n<p>If you are under full retirement age, the earnings test exempt amount rose to $1,770 a month in 2023 from $1,630 a month in 2022. If you have reached FRA, the amount rose to $4,710 a month in 2023 from $4,330 in 2022.<\/p>\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>More From GOBankingRates<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/saving-money\/shopping\/dont-shop-at-dollar-tree-on-this-day-of-the-week\/?utm_term=incontent_link_3&amp;utm_campaign=1252202&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=6&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\">Don&#39;t Shop at Dollar Tree on This Day of the Week<\/a><\/strong><\/li><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/saving-money\/health\/cheap-gym-membership-deals\/?utm_term=incontent_link_4&amp;utm_campaign=1252202&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=7&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\">10 Best Cheap Gym Memberships<\/a><\/strong><\/li><li><strong style=\"color:initial;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/easy-things-you-can-do-to-start-preparing-for-retirement-now-1165700\/?utm_term=incontent_link_5&amp;utm_campaign=1252202&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=8&amp;utm_medium=rss\">3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement<\/a><\/strong><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/taxes\/tax-laws\/type-of-debt-that-terrifies-dave-ramsey\/?utm_term=incontent_link_6&amp;utm_campaign=1252202&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=9&amp;utm_medium=rss\" rel=\"\"><strong>This Is the One Type of Debt That &#39;Terrifies&#39; Dave Ramsey<\/strong><\/a><\/li><\/ul><!-- \/wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><p>This article originally appeared on\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com?utm_term=incontent_link_7&amp;utm_campaign=1252202&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">GOBankingRates.com<\/a>:\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/retirement\/social-security\/6-shakeups-social-security-expected-new-year\/?utm_term=incontent_link_8&amp;utm_campaign=1252202&amp;utm_source=aol.com&amp;utm_content=11&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\">6 Big Shakeups to Social Security in 2023<\/a><\/p>\n                    ",

Here\u2019s what to expect as you pack your bags for a winter getaway or to visit loved ones.<\/p>\n<h2>More affordable airfare<\/h2>\n<p>Airline ticket prices are falling even as more Americans intend to fly.<\/p>\n<p>Deloitte found 33% of holiday travelers plan to take a domestic flight, up from 29% last year. Despite the strong demand, airfares were <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/cpi.t02.htm\">more than 13% cheaper<\/a> last month than at same time a year ago, federal inflation data shows.<\/p>\n<p>Domestic tickets are expected to be noticeably cheaper this season.

About 1.7% of flights were canceled during the first eight months of this year, much better than the 3.0% rate for the same eight-month period last year and 2.3% in the comparable stretch of 2019, the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/content.govdelivery.com\/accounts\/USDOT\/bulletins\/3778f10\">Department of Transportation<\/a> reported. And in August, the latest month with available data, the mishandled baggage rate dropped to 0.61% from 0.75% the month before.<\/p>\n<p>A broader push to streamline and automate operations \u201cwill continue to help curb mishandling as we approach the holiday season,\u201d said Nicole Hogg, head of baggage for SITA, an air transport IT company. But travel experts still suggest adding an AirTag or other digital tracking device to your luggage, especially during busy travel periods.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMother Nature will cause some number of cancellations, guaranteed,\u201d said Scott Keyes, the founder of the airfare tracking site Going. But he noted that \u201ccancellations caused by the airlines \u2014 the most galling for travelers \u2014 are at multiyear lows\u201d and added that many carriers have bulked up on pilots, planes and staff.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe entire industry was snakebit from last year\u2019s debacle,\u201d Keyes said, \u201cand airlines have adjusted their operations accordingly.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Pricier hotel rooms<\/h2>\n<p>More holiday travelers are set to book rooms than exclusively bunk with friends or family this year. Deloitte found 56% plan to stay in hotels, a sharp jump from 35% in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>That could push up room rates, which were already <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/cpi.t02.htm\">0.8% pricier in October than the year before<\/a>. Jan Freitag, director of hospitality analytics at the commercial real-estate research company CoStar, said this season\u2019s strong travel numbers will likely nudge Christmastime room rates above last year\u2019s levels. In the first full week of November, they were up 4% in the U.S. from the same week a year ago, averaging $156 per night, CoStar said.<\/p>\n<p>Price-conscious Christmas travelers might want to \u201cbook early to lock in lower rates, shorten their trips or trade down to a different class of service,\u201d said Freitag, or else take their chances with last-minute reservations. Inventories will be slimmer in the eleventh hour, but hotels may still cut prices on unsold rooms.<\/p>\n<h2>More middle-aged and older seatmates<\/h2>\n<p>Baby boomers, who represented just 21% of those traveling during the holidays in 2022, are expected to make up 29% of travelers this year, Deloitte projects.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLast year, older Americans were more likely to cite potential travel disruption and health as reasons to avoid travel,\u201d said Steve Rogers, managing director of Deloitte\u2019s Consumer Industry Center. \u201cBut this year, inflation, health and travel disruption concerns may have eased, and boomers are making up for lost trips.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Gen X travelers will also comprise a greater share of holiday travelers, Deloitte said, growing from 26% last year to an expected 29% this season. Millennial and Gen Z travelers, by contrast, are expected to fall back a bit \u2014 with millennials going from 36% of holiday travelers last year to 31% this year, and Gen Zers from 14% to just 8%.<\/p>\n<p>How much each age group shells out over the holidays remains to be seen. The market research firm Future Partners found in a survey last month that <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/go.pardot.com\/l\/868421\/2023-11-08\/bt5vjn\/868421\/1699469877mIZOWrz3\/FuturePartners_SATS_Presentation_DECK___NOV_2023.pdf\">boomers tend to have bigger full-year travel budgets<\/a> \u2014 of around $4,408, above the $3,785 national average. However, PwC expects older travelers to trim their holiday travel spending by 22% since last year, partly so they can take more trips throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn the flip side,\u201d said Jonathan Kletzel, PwC\u2019s airline and travel practice leader, \u201cGen Z is making the biggest increase in their [holiday] travel spending, landing around 23% higher than last year.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Growing reasons to tap loyalty points<\/h2>\n<p>This year <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/travel\/2023-holiday-travel-report\">75% of holiday travelers plan to use credit cards<\/a> to cover at least part of their expenses, according to a recent NerdWallet\/Harris Poll survey, even though about 8% of those who charged holiday travel costs last year are still paying them off.<\/p>\n<p>Americans have <a data-i13n=\"cpos:17;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/business\/consumer\/credit-card-debt-rising-as-student-loan-payments-restart-rcna104442\">piled on credit card debt this year<\/a> even as rates have surged. But stiffer interest fees appear to be making some holiday travelers a bit more cautious than last year, when 85% put at least some holiday travel costs on plastic, NerdWallet found.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne way travelers are finding balance between the experiences they want and an increase in costs is through points and customer loyalty programs,\u201d said Kletzel.<\/p>\n<p>A Morning Consul report this month backed that up, showing <a data-i13n=\"cpos:18;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/pro.morningconsult.com\/analyst-reports\/holiday-travel-2023-trends-charts\">across-the-board jumps in consumers planning to use rewards<\/a> for bookings at hotels, travel companies and airlines this season. The share of those making points-based travel reservations through credit card programs rose 13% this Thanksgiving from last year and 9% for the winter holidays.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people are sitting on more credit card rewards and\/or hotel points than they realize, and about a quarter didn\u2019t redeem any over the past year,\u201d said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate. And because travel points typically don\u2019t gain value once netted, he said, \u201cit makes sense to earn and burn rewards strategically.\u201d<\/p>\n                    ",

And in El Ni\u00f1o years during that decade, the same West Coast cities could see up to 10 such 10-year flood events in just one year, the analysis found.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although massive rains and flooding are certainly possible this year, Swain emphasized that a strong El Ni\u00f1o does not necessarily \u201coffer a one-to-one correlation with wintertime precipitation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a very tortured and complicated relationship,\u201d he said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>El Ni\u00f1o does come with huge amounts of moisture, but \u201cthe big wild card\u201d is whether strong, upward vertical movements accompany the \u201cweird blobs of warm water\u201d in the atmosphere, Swain explained.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMoisture in the atmosphere is not enough to produce rain \u2014 you need precipitation-generating mechanisms,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>But Swain stressed that the development of any intense storms and floods would be attributable not just to El Ni\u00f1o, but also to climate change-induced warming.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If California does end up inundated by floods this winter, water expert Jay Lund told The Hill that the state would be \u201cpretty well-prepared.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although last year\u2019s wintry weather took a devastating toll on select small towns and neighborhoods, there was \u201cnothing catastrophic for a large town or city,\u201d according to Lund, director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Lund acknowledged that the Golden State\u2019s reservoirs have remained quite full since last winter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor the bigger storms on the main rivers, they have less flexibility than they did last year this time,\u201d he said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The long-term solution to this quandary, in Lund\u2019s opinion, is to move people out of the floodplain areas, rather than spending billions of dollars to build up flood control infrastructure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just some amount of floods that it\u2019s better to just tolerate the losses,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t build a fireproof house \u2014 you buy fire insurance, because it\u2019s a lot cheaper.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But Lund reiterated that California \u201cshould be pretty well set\u201d for this winter, while recognizing that \u201cthere\u2019s always a chance that you\u2019ll see a flood bigger than what you\u2019re prepared for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While he credited California for performing better than most states with regards to evacuation plans, Lund also stressed that residents should not become complacent.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Right now, he explained, there are about 6,000 miles of levees in California, but just a small portion of one needs to fail \u201cbefore a bunch of people get wet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe nature of our water problems in California, including flood problems, is always changing,\u201d Lund said.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to adapt, and it\u2019ll expensive; it\u2019ll be inconvenient. But if we manage it well, it won\u2019t be catastrophic,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/\">\t\t\t\tFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill. \t\t\t\t<\/a><\/p>\n                    ",

        "description": "\n                        <p>By Nidal al-Mughrabi and James Mackenzie <\/p><p>  GAZA\/JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Hamas gunmen battled Israeli forces trying to push into Gaza&#39;s largest refugee camp on Sunday and at least 11 people were killed by an Israeli air strike on a house, medics said, as hopes rose of a deal to free some hostages from the enclave. <\/p><p>  The Washington Post said on Sunday that U.S. mediators were close to a deal between Israel and Hamas to free dozens of women and children held hostage in Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in their war that would help boost emergency aid shipments to Gaza civilians, citing people familiar with the matter. <\/p><p>  The Post had reported on Saturday that a tentative deal had been reached, but this was denied by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. officials, with a White House spokesperson saying efforts were continuing to clinch a deal. <\/p><p>  On Sunday, however, Israel&#39;s Ambassador to the United States Michael Herzog said in an interview on ABC&#39;s &quot;This Week&quot; that Israel was hopeful a significant number of hostages could be released by Hamas &quot;in coming days&quot;. <\/p><p>  Hamas took about 240 hostages during its deadly cross-border rampage into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to lay siege to Gaza and invade the Palestinian territory to eradicate its ruling Islamist group. <\/p><p>  Reuters reported on Nov. 15 that Qatari mediators had been seeking a deal between Israel and Hamas to exchange 50 hostages in return for a three-day ceasefire, citing an official briefed on the talks. At the time, the official said general outlines had been agreed but Israel was still negotiating details. <\/p><p>  On Sunday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a press conference in Doha that the main sticking points blocking a hostage release deal were now &quot;very minor&quot; - mainly practical and logistical issues. <\/p><p>  The delicate hostage talks coincide with Israel preparing to expand its offensive against Hamas to densely populated Gaza&#39;s southern half, signalled by increasing air strikes there on targets Israel sees as lairs of armed militants. <\/p><p>  Israeli tanks and troops stormed into Gaza late last month after a devastating aerial blitz in response to Hamas&#39;s shock Oct. 7 attack, and say they have wrested control of large areas of the north and northwest and east around Gaza City. <\/p><p>  But guerrilla-style Hamas resistance remains fierce in pockets of the heavily urbanised north, including parts of Gaza City and the sprawling Jabalia and Beach refugee camps, according to Hamas and local witnesses. <\/p><p>  HEAVY FIGHTING <\/p><p>  Witnesses reported heavy fighting overnight between Hamas gunmen and Israeli ground forces trying to advance into Jabalia, the largest of the enclave&#39;s camps with nearly 100,000 people. <\/p><p>  Jabalia has come under repeated Israeli bombardment that has killed scores of civilians, Palestinian medics say. Israel says the strikes have killed many militants sheltering there. <\/p><p>  Via social media in Arabic, Israel&#39;s military on Sunday urged residents of several Jabalia neighbourhoods to evacuate towards south Gaza &quot;to preserve your safety&quot; and to that end said it would pause military action from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. <\/p><p>  After the &quot;pause&quot; period expired, 11 Palestinians in Jabalia were killed by an Israeli air strike on a house, the enclave&#39;s health ministry said. <\/p><p>  Most of Jabalia&#39;s inhabitants rejected previous Israeli appeals to clear out to the south of the narrow coastal enclave. <\/p><p>  The south has also been repeatedly bombarded by Israel, rendering Israeli promises of safety absurd, Palestinians say. <\/p><p>  After several inconclusive wars since 2007, Israel vowed to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack in which around 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed, according to Israeli tallies, the deadliest day in the country&#39;s 75-year history. <\/p><p>  Gaza&#39;s Health Ministry raised its death toll from the unrelenting Israeli bombardment to 12,300, including 5,000 children. <\/p><p>  AIR STRIKES IN CENTRAL GAZA <\/p><p>  In the centre of the narrow coastal enclave, Palestinian medics said 31 people were killed, including two local journalists, in Israeli air strikes targeting a number of houses in the Bureij and Nusseirat refugee camps late on Saturday night. Another air strike killed a woman and her child overnight in the main southern city of Khan Younis, they said. <\/p><p>  In Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, dozens of Palestinians marched to a funeral for 15 residents killed in an Israeli strike on an apartment block on Saturday. &quot;Our youth are dying, women and children are dying, where are the Arab presidents?&quot; wailed Heydaya Asfour, a relative of some of the dead. <\/p><p>  The Israeli army says Hamas uses residential and other civilian buildings as cover for command centres, weapons caches, rocket launchpads and a vast underground tunnel network. The Islamist movement denies using human shields to wage war. <\/p><p>  Hamas&#39;s armed wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said militants killed six soldiers at close range in the village of Juhr al-Dik, just east of Gaza City, after ambushing them with an anti-personnel missile and closing in with machine guns. <\/p><p>  Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting on Saturday, the military said, without giving details. A total of 62 soldiers have died in fighting, according to army tallies. <\/p><p>  &#39;DEATH ZONE&#39; AT GAZA&#39;S BIGGEST HOSPITAL <\/p><p>  A team led by the World Health Organization that visited Al Shifa, Gaza&#39;s biggest hospital, described it as a &quot;death zone&quot;, days after advancing Israeli forces seized the premises to root out an alleged underground Hamas command centre. <\/p><p>  The WHO team reported signs of gunfire and shelling and a mass grave at Al Shifa&#39;s entrance, and said it was making plans for the immediate evacuation of 291 remaining patients, including the war-wounded, and 25 staff. <\/p><p>  On Sunday, 31 premature babies were evacuated from Al Shifa in a joint operation by the U.N. and Palestinian Red Crescent and would be taken over the southern Rafah border crossing to Egypt for hospitalisation there, Gaza&#39;s health ministry said. <\/p><p>  Eight premature babies previously died at Al Shifa for lack of electricity and medications crucial to care, it said. <\/p><p>  Hundreds of other patients, staff and displaced people who were sheltering in Al Shifa left on Saturday, with Palestinian health officials saying they were ejected inhumanely by Israeli troops and the military saying the departures were voluntary. <\/p><p>  Gaza&#39;s traumatised population has been on the move since the start of the war, sheltering in hospitals or moving from the north to the south and, in some cases, back again, in desperate efforts to stay out of the line of fire. <\/p><p>  (Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi, James Mackenzie Henriette Chacar and Reuters bureaux; writing by Kim Coghill and Mark Heinrich; editing by Cynthia Osterman, William Mallard, Hugh Lawson and Andrew Heavens) <\/p>\n                    ",

There they were, clasping signs that read \u201c1,000,\u201d all smiles, with a backdrop of more than 15,000 Michigan fans roaring behind them.<\/p>\n<p>Except, someone was missing: their head coach.<\/p>\n<p>It was all quite indicative of Michigan\u2019s 2023 season, a snapshot of a bizarre, drama-filled year: an unbeaten team reveling in the thrill of another victory while distractions swirl over the NCAA\u2019s probe into the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/timeline-how-the-michigan-sign-stealing-scandal-and-jim-harbaughs-suspension-unfolded-202315375.html\">school\u2019s sign-stealing scheme<\/a>, with its coach, Jim Harbaugh, in the midst of a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/jim-harbaugh-agrees-to-serve-3-game-suspension-as-big-ten-closes-sign-stealing-investigation-202642934.html\">three-game suspension<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday from SECU Stadium \u2014 an interim coach on the sideline, their best receiver injured and their quarterback struggling \u2014 the Wolverines fought through their most challenging, pressure-packed, late-game moments of the season to move to 11-0.<\/p>\n<p>They escaped, you might say. They survived, you may contend.<\/p>\n<p>The seven-point win is 24 points shy of their average margin of victory through their first 10 games.<\/p>\n<p>It was a weird one. Michigan, favored by 18 points, needed two safeties, one off a blocked punt and another on an intentional-grounding penalty in the end zone in the fourth quarter of a one-score game. The Wolverines needed two interceptions from Maryland QB Taulia Tagovailoa, one by Mike Sainristil in the final minutes to secure the victory. They needed a scoop-and-score as well.<\/p>\n<p>On a day in which its offense didn\u2019t break the 300-yard mark, Michigan needed much more: A stellar showing from a defensive front that rolled up four sacks and pressured Tagovailoa into poor decisions or wayward passes; a late-game punt from Tommy Doman to pin Maryland at its own 1-yard line; and a rocking group of visiting fans that came close to outnumbering the home crowd.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be honest: A week after a fairly convincing win in State College, win No. 1,000 was ugly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we needed this test a little bit,\u201d said Michigan running back Blake Corum. \u201cA close one like this. They gave us a run for our money out there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Head coach Mike Locksley and Maryland exposed Michigan\u2019s offense. It flustered quarterback J.J. McCarthy into bad decisions like the one just before halftime, when the Wolverines were a few yards from taking a 30-10 halftime lead. On second-and-goal from the 7-yard line, McCarthy threw his first interception in seven games, 30 quarters and 158 attempts.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_yahoo_sports_800\/b4f2ba2ffd3590577570e9f5bae947eb\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2023-11\/fd2d3760-8662-11ee-a3f7-22d819d98431\" style=\"height:3593px;width:5390px;\" alt=\"Many Michigan fans stormed the field after the Wolverines&#39; win to celebrate with the team.

Oh. Hi. Oh! Beat! Oh. Hi. Oh!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On the plane ride home to Ann Arbor, Corum expects the team\u2019s full attention to turn to the Buckeyes. Already, a few players have watched film of Ohio State during this season. Soon, it\u2019s all Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>This is where a championship can be won and where hopes for the playoff rest, said Sainristil.<\/p>\n<p>This is where legends are made and legacies are established. This is where interim coach Sherrone Moore may entrench himself for the full-time job if Harbaugh leaves this offseason for the NFL.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all about this game \u2014 The Game.<\/p>\n<p>If Moore forgot about that fact, a gaggle of Michigan fans, lurking in the stands minutes after the game, reminded him as he paced to the locker room.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNext week, coach! Next week!\u201d they screamed toward him.<\/p>\n<p>It hasn&#39;t dawned on him yet \u2014 the magnitude of presiding over a Michigan team in The Game. Sixty times, in 118 chances, the Wolverines have won, including the last two \u2014 their first winning streak in the series since 1999-2000.<\/p>\n<p>One week before The Game, Michigan provided ammunition for the doubters. The Wolverines looked mortal, at least offensively. They looked maybe even beatable. And at the very end, they looked\u2026 incomplete \u2014 missing from that photograph the man who helped get them here.<\/p>\n<p>Afterward, Moore smiled when asked about a Harbaugh-less celebration for such a significant milestone in the program\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to edit the coach in there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is enough technology in the world to get that done.\u201d<\/p>\n                    ",

Because you have to&nbsp;carry everything over the river to support the troops there.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian military blogger Rybar also noted the Ukrainian advance in Kherson is troubling&nbsp;after Ukraine secured a bridgehead&nbsp;in a nearby village.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe situation at the site is consistently difficult,\u201d Rybar wrote on Telegram. \u201cAt the moment, the enemy has not abandoned his plans to expand the bridgehead on the left bank of the&nbsp;[Dnipro]. The&nbsp;Ukrainian command is going to continue to carry out offensive operations in the area of&nbsp;the occupied territories, therefore, despite the relative stabilization of the situation, it is too early to relax.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine has raided Russian positions across the Dnipro before but has yet to maintain&nbsp;a position on the eastern bank. Most of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive push has been around the Zaporizhzhia&nbsp;region toward the town of Tokmak and around the destroyed city of Bakhmut in Donetsk.&nbsp;The offensive is expected to continue through the winter, though likely in a more limited way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian forces are continuing offensives against Ukraine as well, working to seize the rest of Luhansk in the northeast and the eastern Donetsk region.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a major push is also happening around\u00a0the town of Avdiivka\u00a0in Donetsk, where Russian forces launched a renewed offensive last month\u00a0but have reportedly suffered\u00a0heavy losses, similar to\u00a0the assault against Bakhmut over the spring.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&nbsp;said the defense of Avdiivka&nbsp;is crucial to his military\u2019s objectives&nbsp;and is wearing down Russian power.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRussia is already losing soldiers and equipment near Avdiivka&nbsp;faster and on a larger scale than, for example, near Bakhmut,\u201d Zelensky&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.president.gov.ua\/en\/news\/kozhen-nash-voyin-yakij-trimaye-poziciyi-pid-avdiyivkoyu-zas-87017\" target=\"_blank\">said in an address<\/a>&nbsp;this week. \u201cIt is extremely difficult to withstand this onslaught.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian forces this week reportedly made&nbsp;incremental advances north of Avdiivka,&nbsp;advancing on a coke plant that is considered strategic for Ukrainian defenders. If the plant falls to Russian hands, that would boost Moscow&#8217;s ability to take the town.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.K. Defense Ministry <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DefenceHQ\/status\/1725050187402367390\" target=\"_blank\">said in an\u00a0intelligence update<\/a>\u00a0that Russian forces are attempting\u00a0a pincer movement to encircle the town, but they have failed to seize outlying areas from Ukraine and would suffer more losses in trying to take the coke plant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe industrial facility provides Ukraine with a localized&nbsp;defensive advantage and Russian forces will probably suffer significant personnel losses if they attempt to assault the facility,\u201d the ministry wrote.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s notorious muddy season during the fall is coming to a close, which will open the door to the harsh winter. While cold temperatures usually slow the tempo of the fighting, the refrozen ground also opens up\u00a0new opportunities for ground vehicles to advance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ukraine\u2019s top general has publicly admitted the counteroffensive will not see a breakthrough anytime soon, and U.S. primary elections begin in January, which will complicate the politics of Ukraine support for Kyiv\u2019s most important backer. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\u00a0larger Russian army is more equipped for a long game, and Russian President Vladimir Putin appears willing to wait it out, said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the\u00a0Brookings\u00a0Institution.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRussia could afford the casualties more with a bigger population base,\u201d he said, adding that Russia also \u201chas no prospect of somebody winning their presidential election next year that&#8217;s going to turn this whole thing around, but the United States does. So time is not on Ukraine&#8217;s side at the moment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former President Trump, the favorite for the GOP presidential nomination, would not be expected to provide firm backing for Ukraine if elected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>O\u2019Hanlon doubted Moscow could achieve a \u201cnet&nbsp;victory\u201d but also expressed little optimism for Ukraine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere&#8217;s certainly no perceptible momentum on either side and very little prospect that I can see [of] that changing anytime soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are more things that could break Russia&#8217;s way in the next few months than there are things that could break Ukraine&#8217;s way in politics and in military terms.

But that method didn\u2019t work at all. The orcas went for the vessel\u2019s rudder, making it impossible to steer. All crew members were ultimately rescued, and Spanish authorities towed the catamaran back to shore, according to the Times.<\/p>\n<p>Using loud music as an attempted deterrent may backfire and harm orcas along with other ocean life, Andrew Trites, the marine mammal research unit director at the University of British Columbia, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/heavy-metal-music-deter-orcas-ramming-sailboat-iberian-coast-2023-11\">told Business Insider<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInitially, the playing of loud sounds underwater might mask the signature sounds of sailboats \u2014 but ultimately, the whales would catch on and use it to more easily locate vessels playing it,\u201d Trites said.<\/p>\n<p>Music loud enough to simply make orcas turn around would be so loud that it would cause pain and likely damage their hearing \u2015 not to mention cause issues for their fellow sea creatures.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest problem with blasting music underwater of any kind is that it is ultimately just adding more noise pollution to the ocean, which can have detrimental effects on other marine life,\u201d Trites said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cContinuous\u201d orca attacks on boats in the region have been reported since 2020, with dozens of incidents and at least three boats totally sinking.

Twelve of the bottles, including the one sold Saturday, had labels designed by Italian painter Valerio Adami.<\/p>\n<p>Another bottle from the same cask was sold by Sotheby\u2019s in 2019 for almost 1.5 million pounds, which was a record for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/liquor\">wine or spirits<\/a> until Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Macallan 1926 is the one whisky that every auctioneer wants to sell and every collector wants to own,\u201d said Jonny Fowle, Sotheby\u2019s global head of spirits.<\/p>\n<p>He said the record-breaking sale was \u201cnothing short of momentous for the whisky industry as a whole. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>The bottle sold Saturday is the first to have undergone reconditioning by the distillery ahead of auction. This included replacing the cork and applying new glue to the corners of the bottle labels.<\/p>\n<p>The final price of 2,187,500 pounds ($2,714,250) includes a charge known as the buyer\u2019s premium on top of the sale price of 1.75 million pounds. The price well exceeded the pre-sale estimate of 750,000 pounds to 1.2 million pounds.<\/p>\n<p>And what is a $2.7 million whisky like? Macallan&#39;s Master Whisky Maker Kirsteen Campbell, who gave the tipple a sniff during the reconditioning, said it contained notes of \u201crich dark fruits, black cherry compote alongside sticky dates, followed by intense sweet antique oak.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDark chocolate, treacle, ginger \u2026 the notes go on and on,\u201d she said. &quot;It was a very special moment to experience the opening of this iconic 60 Years Old single malt, first bottled 37 years ago, and I hope the new custodian will enjoy the same privilege.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n                    ",

While the main character himself is still there to anchor this latest series, it quickly became clear that what made the original sitcom really sing\u2014and run for eleven seasons\u2014was its ensemble cast.<\/p>\n<p>When <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.menshealth.com\/entertainment\/why-niles-david-hyde-pierce-isnt-in-frasier-reboot\/\">David Hyde Pierce declined to participate in the reboot<\/a> as Frasier&#39;s brother Niles, the opportunity for a lot of that much-loved quickfire snarky dialogue was lost. However, there was still a chance that the long-hyped return of Frasier&#39;s ex-wife Lilith would provide some familiar rapid-fire, scathing repartee.<\/p>\n<p>It took until the seventh episode, but we finally got there. Actress Bebe Neuwirth reprised the role of Lilith Crane in &quot;Freddy&#39;s Birthday,&quot; and as anticipated, the non-stop barbs between Frasier and his on-again, off-again partner finally offered a glimpse of what made these characters so fun to watch way back in <em>Cheers<\/em>, where they both originated.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_men_s_health_348\/b2901c97f2b31cf7de6e92201a7f8733\" alt=\"l r kelsey grammer as frasier crane and bebe neuwirth as dr lilith sternin in frasier, episode 7, season 1 streaming on paramount, 2023 photo credit chris hastonparamount\" data-uuid=\"15ce6f5c-fd4f-34b5-8588-7f9f2d48ebb8\"\/><figcaption><span class=\"photo-credit\">Chris Haston<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sadly, this brief revival-within-a-revival was short-lived and looks set to stay that way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of &quot;Freddy&#39;s Birthday,&quot; it is revealed that Freddy has been keeping Frasier and Lilith apart because his parents can&#39;t be in the same room as one another without giving in to their urge to snipe. So even though it is revealed that Lilith has also relocated to Boston, it turns out she&#39;s been keeping her distance\u2014and for good reason, because their reunion soon turns into a &quot;who knows our son better&quot; competition, with Lilith bragging about being closer to Freddy and triggering Frasier&#39;s own guilt at not being there more.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the pair making up and sharing a surprise kiss near the episode&#39;s end, Frasier and Lilith ultimately agree that they&#39;re not good for each other, and should stay out of each other&#39;s lives for the good of their son.<\/p>\n<p>This does, for the most part, track with what we know of Frasier and Lilith from their original run. While their love-hate relationship lent itself to drama and comedy in equal measure, they were always better at being co-parents than they were at being together. And given that Neuwirth only filmed one appearance as Lilith this season, we can believe the on-screen declaration that she will stay away. Unless a second season gets commissioned, of course.
