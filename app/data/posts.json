That it was promoted and funded by Hillary Clinton and her campaign. That it was regurgitated by the media.

It is unclear from the video who shoots first. <\/p><p>Other passengers can be seen rushing to the ground to try avoid getting shot. <\/p><p>Fullard can be seen following Tobias off the bus after he crawled away and continue shooting after him. <\/p><p>Both men sustained critical injuries, but they were hospitalized and expect to fully recover. <\/p><p>Fullard no longer works with the city bus operator after the company said he violated their policies against carrying weapons. <\/p><p>\"We don't want anyone possessing weapons on our vehicles,\" said Brent Cagle, the interim CEO of the Charlotte Area Transit System. <\/p><p>Cagle went on to say that it was standard procedure for drivers to not allow passengers to get off the bus between stops, but that it was up to the discretion of the driver. He also said Fullard failed to use various alarms provided to drivers for such altercations. <\/p><p>Ken Harris, an attorney representing Fullard, said that he had worked with the transit system for 20 years. <\/p><p> \u201cHe loves his job, and he wants to continue to be there, and we want to make sure we address any issues that could come up related to this incident,\" said Harris before he had lost his job. <\/p><p>Harris said that drivers are afraid of violence at their jobs. <\/p><p>\u201cYou have these incidents that happen over and over again, where drivers are being assaulted, shot at, shot or killed,\u201d he explained. <\/p><p>Tobias faces several charges over the incident but it's unclear whether Fullard will face any charges. <\/p><h3>Here's the video of the confrontation: <\/h3><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0a30b742b7f09f2adbd9540daaf7f2f9\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IoRgLsiefdE?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Terrifying bus shootout in Charlotte, North Carolina l WNT<\/small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IoRgLsiefdE\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com<\/a>\n\n        <\/small>\n        <\/p>\n            <p><em>Like Blaze News?

Ted Cruz said, \"The GAO is tasked with investigating federal spending and performance, but under President Biden they're wasting valuable government time and resources on regulating language.\"<\/p><p>Cruz's spokesperson blasted the move as \"typical of the radicals\" and \"just the latest in Biden's relentless push to politicize government agencies,\" the outlet noted.<\/p><p>A spokesperson for the GAO told DailyMail.com, \"This language is currently under review and changes are being considered.\"<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

And we're not going to reward people in Washington that don't do the job they're supposed to do,\" McCarthy said, summarizing pillars of the debt ceiling deal President Biden urged Congress to pass.<\/p><p>\"This is really a step in the right direction ... We let government grow, but at a slower rate,\" McCarthy said, adding that bill places a statutory cap on spending at 1% per year for the next six years.<\/p><p>President Biden characterized the bill as \"an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone.\" <\/p><p>Biden urged the House and Senate to \"pass the agreement right away,\" also outlining the \"catastrophic\" consequences of failing to reach a deal.<\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1662639703764484096\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\">\\u201cEarlier this evening, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement in principle.\\n \\nIt is an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone.

That can no longer happen. [President Biden's] got to cut in order to go forward,\" McCarthy said.<\/p><p>\"This is worthy of the American people,\" McCarthy also said, adding that he wants the citizens to read and understand the roughly 150-page piece of legislation. Similar bills, he said, have exceeded 1,000 pages.<br\/><\/p><p>Expanded work requirements for programs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acf.hhs.gov\/ofa\/programs\/temporary-assistance-needy-families-tanf\" target=\"_blank\">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families<\/a> and the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/snap\/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program\" target=\"_blank\"> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program<\/a>, at one point a \"red line\" for Democrats, McCarthy said, also appear in the bill.<\/p><p>Benefits for those programs will be expanded for veterans and homeless people, but sunset after seven years, McCarthy explained. He also clarified that the work requirements apply to \"able-bodied people with no dependents.\"<\/p><p>\"When you do that, it puts more people to work ... at the end of the day, that this puts our economy [in a] stronger [position], less dependent on China,\" McCarthy said, also criticizing Democrats' initiatives that have discouraged working.<br\/><\/p><p>Regulatory reforms are also part of the package, McCarthy said. One example he provided involved streamlining the process of getting approval for new roads or energy initiatives. The debt ceiling deal's regulatory reforms would cut the time frame for approval in some situations from seven years to one.<\/p><p>McCarthy said the pause on student loan repayments would lift within 60 days if the deal is signed. The move would bring $5 billion a month back into the government's coffers, he also said.<br\/><\/p><p>McCarthy described legislators on the other side of the aisle as \"upset\" about the deal \"because there's not one thing in the bill for Democrats.\"<\/p><p>\"It's a new day, it's a new Congress, and it's a new Republican majority,\" McCarthy said.<\/p><p>Some Republicans, particularly those in the Freedom Caucus, are balking at the deal. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) urged legislators to \"hold the line,\" emphasizing that the deal increases debt by approximately $4 trillion.<\/p><p>\"We could negotiate a 'deal' like this with a Democrat House majority. This would essentially be what they wanted,\" Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) tweeted.<br\/><\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?
