Where\u2019s the fetus going to gestate? You gonna keep it in a box?\"<\/p><p>Other characters agree that Stan can't have babies, but argue that he should have the \"right to have babies.\" <\/p><p>Reg responds, \"What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies when he can't have babies?\" <\/p><p>Another character says, \"It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.\" <\/p><p>Reg quips that Stan has a \"struggle with reality\" for thinking he can give birth to a baby. <\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"1b17a324c81be6c911519b3716cf550e\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Dgp9MPLEAqA?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Monty Python - \"Loretta\"<\/small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dgp9MPLEAqA\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com<\/a>\n\n        <\/small>\n        <\/p>\n            <p>Critics claim the scene in the movie from 44 years ago is \"<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=life%20of%20brian%20transphobia&src=typed_query\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">transphobic<\/a>.\" <\/p><p>Despite the controversy, Cleese confirmed that he would not be removing the questionable scene from the upcoming stage show of \"Life of Brian.\" <\/p><p>Cleese wrote on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JohnCleese\/status\/1661672993657962497\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a>, \"A few days ago I spoke to an audience outside London.

And we're not going to reward people in Washington that don't do the job they're supposed to do,\" McCarthy said, summarizing pillars of the debt ceiling deal President Biden urged Congress to pass.<\/p><p>\"This is really a step in the right direction ... We let government grow, but at a slower rate,\" McCarthy said, adding that bill places a statutory cap on spending at 1% per year for the next six years.<\/p><p>President Biden characterized the bill as \"an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone.\" <\/p><p>Biden urged the House and Senate to \"pass the agreement right away,\" also outlining the \"catastrophic\" consequences of failing to reach a deal.<\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1662639703764484096\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\">\\u201cEarlier this evening, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement in principle.\\n \\nIt is an important step forward that reduces spending while protecting critical programs for working people and growing the economy for everyone.

That can no longer happen. [President Biden's] got to cut in order to go forward,\" McCarthy said.<\/p><p>\"This is worthy of the American people,\" McCarthy also said, adding that he wants the citizens to read and understand the roughly 150-page piece of legislation. Similar bills, he said, have exceeded 1,000 pages.<br\/><\/p><p>Expanded work requirements for programs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acf.hhs.gov\/ofa\/programs\/temporary-assistance-needy-families-tanf\" target=\"_blank\">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families<\/a> and the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/snap\/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program\" target=\"_blank\"> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program<\/a>, at one point a \"red line\" for Democrats, McCarthy said, also appear in the bill.<\/p><p>Benefits for those programs will be expanded for veterans and homeless people, but sunset after seven years, McCarthy explained. He also clarified that the work requirements apply to \"able-bodied people with no dependents.\"<\/p><p>\"When you do that, it puts more people to work ... at the end of the day, that this puts our economy [in a] stronger [position], less dependent on China,\" McCarthy said, also criticizing Democrats' initiatives that have discouraged working.<br\/><\/p><p>Regulatory reforms are also part of the package, McCarthy said. One example he provided involved streamlining the process of getting approval for new roads or energy initiatives. The debt ceiling deal's regulatory reforms would cut the time frame for approval in some situations from seven years to one.<\/p><p>McCarthy said the pause on student loan repayments would lift within 60 days if the deal is signed. The move would bring $5 billion a month back into the government's coffers, he also said.<br\/><\/p><p>McCarthy described legislators on the other side of the aisle as \"upset\" about the deal \"because there's not one thing in the bill for Democrats.\"<\/p><p>\"It's a new day, it's a new Congress, and it's a new Republican majority,\" McCarthy said.<\/p><p>Some Republicans, particularly those in the Freedom Caucus, are balking at the deal. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) urged legislators to \"hold the line,\" emphasizing that the deal increases debt by approximately $4 trillion.<\/p><p>\"We could negotiate a 'deal' like this with a Democrat House majority. This would essentially be what they wanted,\" Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) tweeted.<br\/><\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

Trezevant is assigned to the criminal probe and is listed on court filings related to the search at Burke and Hurtak's home. <\/blockquote><p>Importantly, neither Burke nor Hurtak have been accused of wrongdoing. <\/p><p>Still, a judge must have agreed that federal investigators would have located evidence of a crime in the home because investigators had gathered probable cause for the search warrant.
