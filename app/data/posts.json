While at the gentleman's club, the man paid for private dances from six women, including 34-year-old exotic dancer Yannelin Rivera-Bosaw.

Selling weapons. <strong><\/strong>Well, guess what?

However, she later changed her mind and decided to share it in the hopes that it might prevent her kids from enduring a similar experience someday. \"My kids one day, just because they go to one church or like one person or support one team, if they can\u2019t work somewhere, that\u2019s not okay,\" she said.<\/p><p>On Wednesday, she shared a video of her song \"Freedom in This Country\" on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CarlyTefft\/status\/1669065773644390410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1669065773644390410%7Ctwgr%5Eadff50acb5fa6701ad8b35a772ef01f41b2bb414%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Farticle-12198655%2FCountry-star-Carly-Tefft-says-performances-axed-sang-national-anthem-Trump-rally.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a>, hinting that now might be a good time to \"re-release\" it in light of her situation.<\/p><p>Representatives of Harvest Gallery did not respond to a request for comment from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/music\/news\/country-singer-claims-venue-canceled-gigs-because-she-sang-the-national-anthem-at-a-trump-event\/ar-AA1czOWJ\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News<\/a>.

Beginning on June 12, participating stores will offer the Grimace Birthday Meal, a combo meal which includes the choice of a Big Mac or 10-piece Chicken McNuggets, fries, and a shake colored purple for the occasion. <\/p><p>The company hopes that the birthday celebration will help introduce Grimace and his friends to younger generations who may not be as familiar with the McDonald's characters as well as give older generations a chance to revisit part of their youth. \"Grimace is the perfect lovable icon to have McDonald\u2019s meet our fans at the intersection of nostalgia and culture,\" said Tariq Hassan, chief marketing and customer experience officer at McDonald\u2019s USA.<\/p><p>To promote the campaign, McDonald's has turned over its social-media <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CtHadIsO_Cc\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MWQ1ZGUxMzBkMA==\" target=\"_blank\">accounts<\/a> to the birthday boy. And while recent posts from those accounts just show Grimace having fun with friends and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/McDonalds\/status\/1665745466322046980\" target=\"_blank\">cracking jokes<\/a>, others on social media have taken the occasion of his birthday to turn Grimace into what outlets such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insider.com\/mcdonalds-grimace-marketing-takeover-internet-memes-2023-6\" target=\"_blank\">Insider<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/entertainment\/gaming\/fans-are-going-all-in-on-celebrating-grimace-s-birthday-and-declaring-him-a-gay-icon\/ar-AA1cyAXJ\" target=\"_blank\">Polygon<\/a> have called a \"queer icon.\" Such users have featured Grimace in cartoon images waving a Pride flag. In one, he plants a kiss on the cheek of Hamburglar, another male character.<\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1668499641573474304\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\">\\u201cHEY GRIMACE HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND HAPPY PRIDE\\u201d<\/div> \u2014 Pilan \\u2b50 (@Pilan \\u2b50)\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/piophany\/status\/1668499641573474304\">1686636288<\/a>\n    <\/blockquote>\n        <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\"><\/script><p><br\/><\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1668802026602647554\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\">\\u201cgrimace goes to pride\\u201d<\/div> \u2014 Oscar Vega (@Oscar Vega)\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/raspbearyart\/status\/1668802026602647554\">1686708382<\/a>\n    <\/blockquote>\n        <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\"><\/script><p>One TikTok <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@spookyquill\/video\/7244000153852562731?embed_source=121352282%2C121351166%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&refer=embed&referer_url=www.polygon.com%2F23761120%2Fmcdonalds-grimace-shake-game-boy-birthday-pride-memes&referer_video_id=7244000153852562731\" target=\"_blank\">video<\/a> even appears to show a grown man having an image of Grimace wearing a bikini, fishnet stockings, and women's heels tattooed on his thigh. The caption of the video reads, \"happy birthday to our queen, grimace from mcdonalds.\"<\/p><p>While some of the images and videos floating around the internet may be made by trolls with few followers, the image with the kiss has garnered nearly 5,000 likes in under three days, and the tattoo video has already attracted a whopping 18,000 likes. For context, a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/McDonalds\/status\/1669003231559659525\" target=\"_blank\">tweet<\/a>, ostensibly from Grimace, that was posted on the official McDonald's account on Wednesday has just 1,500. Other posts from the account regularly have tens of thousands of likes. <\/p><p>Although the images are not directly affiliated with the company, they still feature one of its beloved characters \u2014 characters that have been marketed to children for 50 years. In fact, when Grimace was first introduced in the 1970s, he was a villainous character who frightened children so much that the company soon reintroduced him in a softer, friendlier version that we still have today.<\/p><p>The press release about the promotion for Grimace's birthday makes no mention of LGBTQ issues or Pride Month, but the company website still has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcdonalds.com\/us\/en-us\/community\/lgbtq-plus.html\" target=\"_blank\">page<\/a> called \"Share the Pride,\" which is dedicated to the LGBTQ+ community. The website offers similar pages for Hispanic students, Asian-Pacific Americans, and the \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcdonalds.com\/us\/en-us\/black-and-positively-golden.html\" target=\"_blank\">Black & Positively Golden<\/a>.\" <\/p><p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.mcdonalds.com\/corpmcd\/our-stories\/article\/mcd-pride-network-force-forgood-year-round.html\" target=\"_blank\">press release<\/a> dated May 30 also claimed that \"McDonald\u2019s PRIDE Network is a Force for Good Year-Round.\" In the statement, the company notes that it has provided its employees \"a $100,000 lifetime limit toward gender reassignment surgery; prescription coverage for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention and a variety of gender reassignment medications.\" None of the McDonald's characters is mentioned in the statement.<\/p><p>While some on social media have co-opted Grimace as a member or ally of the LGBTQ community, others are still struggling to understand just who \u2014 or what \u2014 Grimace is. One McDonald's <a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2021\/09\/08\/what-is-mcdonalds-grimace-manager-reveals-shocking-truth\/\" target=\"_blank\">manager<\/a> suggested in 2021 that he is \"an enormous taste bud,\" but corporate officials did not confirm that classification. <\/p><p><span><\/span>For those interested in more information about Grimace, the press release about his birthday did provide a helpful bio: \"Grimace is from Grimace Island and comes from a huge family (including his Grandma Winky, aunts Millie and Tillie and his Uncle O'Grimacey!) Our timeless bestie has become a fan-favorite known for his signature fuzzy purple look, friendly and playful personality, love for shakes, and of course \u2013 ambiguous nature. What exactly is Grimace? Perhaps we\u2019ll never know...\"<\/p><p>Grimace's actual birthday and how old he will be are both unclear. McDonald's did not respond to a request for comment about the social media portrayals of him.<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

I jumped up with my pistol and said get the f*** out of my house!\"<\/p><p>The trespasser allegedly told the homeowner that he was the intruder. <\/p><p>The homeowner recalled the man telling him, \"'You don\u2019t belong here, you don\u2019t own this house! This house has been vacant for three years.'\"<\/p><p>The homeowner replied, \"Get the f*** out of my house!\"<br\/><\/p><p>The purported home intruder allegedly said, \"You can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re going to jail! I\u2019m going to call police!' I said, \u2018Go, good, call police.\u2019 And he did.\"<\/p><p>When the alleged home intruder refused to leave the house, the homeowner fired a warning shot into the bottom left corner of the front door, according to the affidavit. <\/p><p>The alleged home intruder then fled from the house. <\/p><p>The homeowner contacted the Marion County Sheriff's Office, officers of which later arrested 26-year-old Ze\u2019Moye Brown. <\/p><p>Brown reportedly told investigators that he had been living at that house for \"a few months,\" and he was the only one staying there. He allegedly said in the interview that the house had been vacant for three years and that the windows and doors were unlocked. Brown claimed that he didn't steal any of the items. <\/p><p>When deputies searched Brown, they found a rock-like substance in his pants pocket, which later tested positive for methamphetamine. He also is accused of possessing a small baggy of marijuana.<\/p><p>When police asked the homeowner if he wanted to press charges against Brown, he suggested only trespassing charges. <\/p><p>He told police, \"I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want the guy to go to jail. He reminds me of my son, in a way. Tall, skinny, too smart for his own good, and dumb as a bag of rocks at the same time.\"<\/p><p>Brown was charged with misdemeanor trespassing, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and felony possession of a controlled substance without a prescription. Brown is being held on $4,000 bond. He is scheduled to return to court on July 11. <\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"ae448b26ccc5cd2b309f9c42e11e05e0\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Vk4wmi_y7S4?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Ocala homeowner slept in closet awaiting squatter who trashed his home<\/small>\n        <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">\n            \n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vk4wmi_y7S4\" target=\"_blank\">www.youtube.com<\/a>\n\n        <\/small>\n        <\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

However, he vetoed a bill which would have protected medical professionals who provide gender-related treatment from losing their license.

They put it in an envelope. Johnson said, \u2018Not till I die give it to my library.\u2019 And then the library got it and they were sitting on it for 50 years, they were told to, involving top secret information about Vietnam and tapping the phone of Richard Nixon.\u201d <\/p><p>But apparently, no one remembers that. <\/p><p>Levin brings up Hillary Clinton as an example as well. <\/p><p>\u201cHillary Clinton was never investigated for obstruction,\u201d Levin continues, \u201cthey didn\u2019t investigate her for perjury and there was plenty of false statements \u2014 they didn\u2019t even investigate her for that.\u201d <\/p><p>\u201cThe evidence is beyond anything that we\u2019ve seen with a former secretary of State,\u201d he adds. <\/p><p>Even when Bill Clinton kept highly classified information \u201cin his sock drawer\u201d after leaving office, he was met with much less scrutiny. <\/p><p>\u201cJudicial Watch brings a lawsuit and says, \u2018Hey, National Archives go get those.

So it gets in front of this Clinton judge,\u201d Levin explains. <\/p><p>The judge then reads the law. <\/p><p>Levin says the judge reads \u201cthe Presidential Records Act, not the Espionage Act. Or Clinton would be doing 50 years with his wife by now.\u201d<\/p><p>Frustrated, Levin notes that President Joe Biden is \u201ca former segregationist and racist\u201d who is \u201cusing the Espionage Act to try and destroy our country.\u201d<\/p><h3><\/h3><br\/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"a637d7126731cdf32cb20c1be7ebc6a6\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bKzexBNjHK4?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span><h3><strong>Want more from Mark Levin?<\/strong><\/h3><p>To enjoy more of \"the Great One\" \u2014 Mark Levin as you've never seen him before \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/get.blazetv.com\/levin\/?utm_source=theblaze...%22%20target=%22_blank%22>\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe to BlazeTV <\/a>\u2014 the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.<\/p>",

The president is pressing Democrats to make the economic case on a host of issues from improving job satisfaction to the performance of the US economy versus the world.<\/p><p>But, as Biden acknowledged in his Saturday speech, &quot;we&#39;ve got a fight on our hands&quot; with Republicans also champing at the bit to talk about the economy nonstop.<\/p><p>An example from the last week came when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen traveled to Capitol Hill and faced a panel of Republicans who openly scoffed at her message of a strong economy.<\/p><p>In one memorable exchange, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) charged that when it comes to the economy, the Biden administration &quot;cherry-picks the factors that yield the most convincing numbers for whatever narrative they want to assert.&quot;<\/p><p>&quot;Americans know better,&quot; he added in remarks that also focused on the lingering effects of inflation.

His contributions will always be a part of our history.&quot;<\/p><\/blockquote><p>If this is really it for Huggins&#39; career, much of the good will he had built up over the course of decades will have evaporated in the span of two months.<\/p><h2>Bob Huggins&#39; full resignation letter<\/h2><blockquote><p>Mountaineer Nation:<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>Today, I have submitted a letter to President Gordon Gee and Vice President and Director of Athletics Wren Baker informing them of my resignation and intention to retire as head men&#39;s basketball coach at West Virginia University effective immediately.<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>My recent actions do not represent the values of the University or the leadership expected in this role. While I have always tried to represent our University with honor, I have let all of you \u2013 and myself \u2013 down. I am solely responsible for my conduct and sincerely apologize to the University community \u2013 particularly to the student-athletes, coaches and staff in our program. I must do better, and I plan to spend the next few months focused on my health and my family so that I can be the person they deserve.<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>It has been the honor of my professional career to lead the men&#39;s basketball program at my alma mater and I take great pride in our accomplishments. But I am most proud of the tremendous young men who chose to spend their formative years with us, and who have gone on to do great things with their lives.<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>I was born in Morgantown, graduated from West Virginia University and had the pleasure of coaching here for seventeen seasons as an assistant or head coach. It will always be my home, and I will always be a Mountaineer.<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>Thank you to everyone who has supported our program over the years. It has meant more to me and my family than you could ever know.<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>Sincerely,<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>Bob Huggins<\/p><\/blockquote>",

        "description": "<p>BELMONT, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Amy Yang birdied all five par 5s at Blythefield and shot her third straight 5-under 67 to take the third-round lead Saturday in the Meijer LPGA Classic.<\/p><p>Yang rebounded from bogeys on the par-3 11th and 13th to birdie the par-5 14th, par-4 17th and par-5 18th to reach 15-under 201 on the tree-lined course.<\/p><p>\u201cAll week my ball-striking has been really good,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI was giving myself good chances out there. I was a little bit off with putting speed during the round, made a couple mistakes, but I tried to stay patient and just keep trying throughout the round.\u201d<\/p><p>The 33-year-old Yang has won all four of her LPGA Tour titles in Asia \u2014 the LPGA KEB-HanaBank in 2013 in her native South Korea and the Honda LPGA Thailand in 2015, 2017 and 2019.<\/p><p>The Grand Rapids-area event is the final tournament before the major KPMG Women\u2019s PGA next week at Baltusrol and the U.S. Women&#39;s Open at Pebble Beach on July 6-9.<\/p><p>\u201cI know KPMG is coming and another two weeks after that U.S. Open is coming,\u201d Yang said. \u201cAlways doing my best to win my first major out there. If I play well this week it\u2019ll definitely give me good confidence going into a major.\u201d<\/p><p>Ashleigh Buhai, the 34-year-old South African who won the ShopRite LPGA Classic last week in New Jersey, was a stroke back with second-round leader Ayaka Furue of Japan and Xiyu Lin of China.<\/p><p>Buhai followed a bogey on 17 with an eagle 18 for a 66.<\/p><p>\u201cMindset is exactly the same as the last few months,\u201d Buhai said. \u201cJust trying to do my job well when I get to the ball. Only focus on one thing that I\u2019m trying to focus on, particularly when I\u2019m swinging, chipping, just do that one thing well. When I\u2019m putting, try to do that one thing well.\u201d<\/p><p>Lin also shot 66, and Furue had a 69.<\/p><p>Ariya Jutanugarn (66), Hyo Joo Kim (69) and Leona Maguire (69) were 13 under. Defending champion Jennifer Kupcho (69) was 12 under with Manon De Roey (69) and Lindsey Weaver-Wright (69).&nbsp;<\/p><p>Kupcho had an eagle and four birdies, but made three bogeys for the second day in a row.<\/p><p>\u201cDefinitely didn\u2019t play as well as I thought I would,&quot; Kupcho said. &quot;Certainly, moving day, did not take full advantage of it. I still kept it together with what I had today and just want to go recover and come out, hopefully, and play well tomorrow.&quot;<\/p><p>___<\/p><p>AP golf: <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/golf\">https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/golf<\/a> and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AP_Sports\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/AP_Sports<\/a><\/p>",

He was 81 years old.<\/p><p>Over the course of his 10-season career, Brown played for the Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams and Oakland Raiders between 1964 and 1973.

He believed that he could hit you with his forearm and take a quarter out of you. In other words, if he really hit you, you wouldn\u2019t play hard until the next quarter.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>Gene Upshaw: \u201cBob was the most intimidating player I\u2019ve ever seen. I had opponents come up to me during games and say, \u2018Gene, tell Bob to stop hitting me.\u2019\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>Carl Eller: \u201cBob Brown was probably my most feared competitor. He would strike out at you. His intent was to do bodily harm. He wanted to inflict pain.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>Tommy Nobis: \u201cBob hit me, and it felt like the world turned upside down. I\u2019ve never been hit like that before.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The second overall pick in the 1964 NFL Draft, Brown was a unanimous All-American in his final season at Nebraska and is one of only three players to have his number retired by the storied program, alongside Tom Novak and Johnny Rodgers.<\/p><p>His pro career began with the Eagles, though the Denver Broncos also selected him fourth overall in the 1964 AFL Draft. Brown requested a trade from the Eagles after five seasons, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot; per the HOF, then landed with the Rams in a trade that included four other players.<\/p><p>Brown was traded to the Raiders two seasons later and became an integral part of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/nfl\/raiders\/the-black-hole-plus\/nfl-oakland-raiders-gene-upshaw-jim-otto-art-shell-al-davis\">one of the best offensive lines of all time<\/a>. In addition to Brown, the 1971 Raiders line included four other Hall of Famers in Upshaw, center Jim Otto and tackles Art Shell and Ron Mix. Tight end Dave Casper was also a Hall of Famer.<\/p><p>Retirement came prematurely for Brown, whose knee issues forced him to end his career in 1973. His days as a punishing blocker ended, but Hall of Fame president Jim Porter noted he remained a caring father:<\/p><blockquote><p>\u201cBob Brown demonstrated different personalities on and off the field,\u201d Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in a statement Saturday. \u201cOn the field, he was as fierce an opponent as any defensive linemen or linebacker ever faced. He used every tactic and technique \u2013 and sometimes brute force \u2013 to crush the will of the person across the line from him. And took great pride in doing so.<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cYet off the field, he demonstrated a quiet, soft-spoken and caring nature that his son, Robert Jr., captured eloquently when he presented his dad for enshrinement in 2004.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Brown was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -     Mexican authorities found 129 migrants, mostly from Guatemala, crowded into a truck trailer in the eastern state of Veracruz, the National Migration Institute (INM) said in a statement on Saturday.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The migrants were crammed into a trailer in the midst of a heat wave in Mexico, where higher-than-normal temperatures have topped 45C (113F) in several states, including Veracruz, where the operation took place.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration agents in late May had uncovered another 175 migrants further south, mainly from Central America, in Chiapas state. Another 300 people were stopped at a checkpoint in Veracruz in March.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Latin America frequently pay smugglers in an attempt to pass through Mexico bound for the U.S. Some are forced to cross areas rife with drug violence, making them vulnerable to organized crime.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the travelers found on Friday were adults from Guatemala, Honduras, India and El Salvador, and 19 unaccompanied minors, the migration institute said.

Four suspected traffickers were arrested in the operation.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday the commissioner of the INM, Francisco Gardu\u00f1o, had met with Guatemalan officials to discuss reparations for the victims of a deadly March fire in a migrant detention center in Mexico that claimed 39 lives, the INM said in a separate statement.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reporting by Lucinda Elliott and Aida Pelaez-Fernandez; Editing by Franklin Paul)&nbsp;<\/p>",

        "title": "DeSantis quiet on Trump indictment as he faces conservatives in Trump country",
        "description": "<p>GARDNERVILLE, Nevada (AP) \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday condemned Walt Disney World and the U.S. Justice Department \u2014 not his chief Republican rival, Donald Trump \u2014 as he courted Nevada Republicans deep in the heart of Trump country.<\/p><p>The U.S. \u201cis off the rails,\u201d the Republican governor said. \u201cInsanity is reigning supreme.\u201d<\/p><p>Speaking to Nevada Republicans for the first time as a presidential candidate, DeSantis made no direct mention of the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/trump-classified-documents-indictment-miami-court-e9412bb71b63ab1b7cfb8e8b122e9809\">federal indictment of Trump<\/a>, who is facing dozens of felony counts for mishandling classified documents.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to end this weaponization of government once and for all,\u201d said DeSantis, donning an untucked short-sleeve shirt from a podium adorned with bales of hay and bull horns.<\/p><p>The comments come as the GOP&#39;s crowded 2024 presidential class grapples with how to respond to Trump&#39;s recent indictment. While some Republicans have raised serious concerns about the charges, DeSantis has largely ignored the situation, touching on it only generally by attacking the Justice Department.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Looking up at Trump in many polls, it&#39;s unclear if DeSantis can catch Trump by avoiding one of the dominant issues in the race.<\/p><p>The debate was playing out as DeSantis courted more than 2,000 conservatives, many Trump loyalists among them, who gathered for an annual Basque Fry under a blazing sun at a western Nevada ranch.&nbsp;<\/p><p>DeSantis&#39; team believes he is especially well-positioned to compete with Trump in Nevada, one of the first four states to host a presidential primary contest early next year.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Beyond issues like his \u201cwar on woke,&quot; DeSantis also hopes to benefit from a close personal connection with a top Republican leader. Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general and host of Saturday\u2019s gathering, was a roommate of DeSantis during naval officer training and has long remained a friend. Despite serving as Trump\u2019s Nevada chairman during the 2020 election, Laxalt already lined up behind the Florida governor by becoming the chairman of DeSantis\u2019 national super PAC.<\/p><p>\u201cI believe Gov. DeSantis is the only person in America who can win the primary and the general and be a conservative warrior for all of us,\u201d Laxalt said as he introduced DeSantis.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Despite his optimism, it was unclear on Saturday how many Republican voters in this pivotal western state were convinced to abandon Trump. There was only a smattering of polite applause as the early speakers tried to cast DeSantis as the GOP&#39;s best hope in 2024.<\/p><p>Don Fautt, a Republican voter from nearby Sparks, Nevada, said he would support DeSantis in the upcoming primary only if Trump were not on the ballot.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cTrump is the only guy who can go in and fix things,&quot; Fautt insisted. \u201cI get tired of his mouth, but I&#39;ll tell you what: He&#39;s a warrior. He&#39;ll fight. That&#39;s what we need.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p>Once he took the stage, DeSantis played up his willingness to fight any and all political opponents \u2014 especially Disney.&nbsp;<\/p><p>He told his Nevada audience that the children\u2019s entertainment giant is \u201csupporting the sexualization of minors.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p>The feud between the Florida governor and the Florida entertainment giant started last year after the company, in the face of significant pressure, publicly opposed legislation concerning lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades that critics called <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/desantis-florida-dont-say-gay-ban-684ed25a303f83208a89c556543183cb\">\u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay.\u201d<\/a><\/p><p>As punishment, DeSantis took over <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/ron-desantis-politics-florida-state-government-36ec16b56ac6e72b9efcce26defdd0d8\">Disney World\u2019s governing district<\/a> through legislation passed by lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors.<\/p><p>DeSantis was speaking out at Laxalt\u2019s annual Basque Fry, an event modeled after cookouts hosted by the former Nevada attorney general\u2019s grandfather, U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt \u2014 the son of a Basque immigrant sheepherder.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In recent years, the event has emerged as a key stop on the Republican presidential circuit, drawing rising stars who hoped to boost their White House ambitions and endear themselves to voters through sampling the local fare. Unlike the pork chops and butter sculptures of the Iowa State Fair, the cuisine at the Basque Fry includes beans, chorizo and \u2014 for those daring enough \u2014 the event\u2019s signature fried lamb testicles.<\/p><p>DeSantis spent much of the afternoon in a large barn with VIPs and event sponsors before taking the stage.

        "description": "<p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 The city of St. George must issue a permit for a Utah-based group that organizes drag performances to host an all-ages drag show in a public park, a federal judge ruled, calling the city&#39;s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/utah-drag-show-permit-lawsuit-st-george-c693e67f5f9ff53055a8f4e5b501b6d9\">attempt to stop the show<\/a> unconstitutional discrimination.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cPublic spaces are public spaces. Public spaces are not private spaces. Public spaces are not majority spaces,\u201d U.S. District Judge David Nuffer wrote in a Friday ruling granting the preliminary injunction requested by the group. \u201cThe First Amendment of the United States Constitution ensures that all citizens, popular or not, majority or minority, conventional or unconventional, have access to public spaces for public expression.\u201d<\/p><p>Southern Utah Drag Stars and its CEO, Mitski Aval\u014dx, sued the city of St. George in May after the city denied the group permits for an all-ages show it aimed to host in a public park in April. A complaint filed in federal court accused city officials of \u201cflagrant and ongoing violations of their free speech, due process, and equal protection rights,\u201d and asked for St. George to reverse its decision and authorize a drag show at the end of June.<\/p><p>A city events coordinator told Drag Stars, Aval\u014dx said, that the group could start advertising for the April show before obtaining a permit. The city council later denied the permit, citing a never-previously-enforced ordinance that forbids advertising before permit approval.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The permit denial based on that ordinance, Nuffer wrote in his ruling, was a pretext for discrimination.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cPublic officials take an oath to \u2018support, obey, and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Utah,\u2019\u201d Nuffer wrote. \u201cThey do not merely serve the citizens who elect them, the majority of citizens in the community, or a vocal minority in the community.&quot;<\/p><p>The city now may not enforce any new advertising prohibitions against the group or its show, Nuffer ruled, ordering that the performance must \u201ctake scheduling precedence over any other event.\u201d<\/p><p>In a statement, the city of St. George said it is committed to ensuring public parks and facilities remain viable and open to residents and those who want to hold special events.<\/p><p>\u201cOur intent is always to follow the law both when we enact laws and when we enforce laws, and we will continue to do so,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have read Judge Nuffer\u2019s opinion and while we are disappointed in the result, we are currently evaluating our options in light of the ruling.\u201d<\/p><p>The lawsuit marked the most recent development in a fight over drag shows in St. George, Utah, a conservative city 111 miles (179 kilometers) northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. Since HBO filmed a drag show in a public park last year for an episode of its series \u201cWe\u2019re Here,&quot; the city has emerged as a flashpoint in the nationwide battle over drag performances as they\u2019ve garnered newfound political scrutiny in Republican-controlled cities and states.<\/p><p>Public events like drag queen story hours and the all-ages event that Aval\u014dx intended to put together have been increasingly <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/drag-queens-tennessee-bill-legislation-3ed2ddd0e8231819ade5d0c8b9f4c30a\">targeted<\/a> in legislatures throughout the country.

        "title": "Russia's Putin rebuts key elements of African peace plan for Ukraine",
        "description": "<p>(Reuters) -     Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday gave African leaders seeking to mediate in the war in Ukraine a list of reasons why he believed many of their proposals were misguided, pouring cold water on a plan already largely dismissed by Kyiv.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The African leaders were seeking agreement on a series of &quot;confidence building measures&quot;, even as Kyiv last week began a counteroffensive to push back Russian forces from the swathes of southern and eastern Ukraine that they occupy.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said after meeting them in Kyiv on Friday that peace talks would require Moscow to withdraw its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory, something Russia has said is not negotiable.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Putin opened Saturday&#39;s talks with representatives of Senegal, Egypt, Zambia, Uganda, Congo Republic, Comoros and South Africa in a palace near St Petersburg by stressing Russia&#39;s commitment to the continent.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But after presentations from the Comoran, Senegalese and South African presidents, he stepped in to challenge the assumptions of the plan - predicated on acceptance of internationally recognised borders - before the round of statements could go any further.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Putin reiterated his position that Ukraine and its Western allies had started the conflict long before Russia sent its armed forces over the border in February last year, something they deny.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the West, not Russia, was responsible for a sharp rise in global food prices early last year that has hit Africa especially hard.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the delegation that Ukrainian grain exports from Black Sea ports that Russia has permitted for the past year were doing nothing to alleviate Africa&#39;s difficulties with high food prices because they had largely gone to wealthy countries.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said Russia had never refused talks with the Ukrainian side, which had been blocked by Kyiv. Moscow has, however, repeatedly said any peace must allow for &quot;new realities&quot;, meaning its declared annexation of five Ukrainian provinces, four of which it only partially controls - a red line for Kyiv.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in televised remarks that Moscow shared the &quot;main approaches&quot; of the African plan, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying it was &quot;difficult to realise&quot;.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Peskov said Putin had shown interest in the plan, whose 10 points South African President Cyril Ramaphosa laid out in his presentation, and Russia would continue dialogue with the African countries.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavrov said they had not brought the Russian leader any message from Zelenskiy.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Putin said Moscow was &quot;open to constructive dialogue with anyone who wants to establish peace on the principles of fairness and acknowledgement of the legitimate interests of the parties&quot;.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no immediate word on the bilateral talks that Ramaphosa, host of a summit in August featuring Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, had said he would have with Putin.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the International Criminal Court indicted Putin in March on war crimes charges - which he rejects - South Africa, as a member of the court, finds itself in the awkward position of being obliged to arrest him if he sets foot there.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Writing by Kevin Liffey; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Andrew Heavens)&nbsp;<\/p>",

My first concern is that the chenille will be slippery, but it\u2019s not at all. It has just enough grip, just enough slide, and I\u2019m able to \u201cclean as I go\u201d like my mom \u2014 except I\u2019m actually cleaning up from last night\u2019s dinner while making this morning\u2019s coffee. This is fun. I turn on some music and find myself skating around the kitchen, lunging here and there. I\u2019m picking up specks while getting some much-needed functional exercise.<\/p><p>Next surface \u2014 actual hardwood. Doing yoga in my living room means an intimate downward-dog view of the film of dust that collects under the coffee table and elsewhere. I shimmy over there and swipe trouble spots with my super-powered chenille feet, then strike a downward dog to check my work. Clean as a whistle.<\/p><p>White-and-black tile in the bathroom shows dirt more than anything else in the house. I decide to flip one chenille slipper inside out so I can do \u201cdetail work.\u201d Turns out I\u2019m a genius. Not only does the finer side of the slipper pick up dirt from the grouted spots between tiles, but it also inspires me to run a pointed foot along the metal baseboard (where dust loves to live). Swish, clean in a second, no bending over, no paper towels to add to the landfill. A win-win.<\/p><p>The wood stairs are my nemesis when it comes to dust. Back to my Old West metaphor, it seems like a place tumbleweeds park for a rest. Moving top to bottom, I give each step a quick corner-to-corner sweep. <em>Voil\u00e0.<\/em>\u00a0<\/p><h2><strong>Versatile and easy to wash<\/strong><\/h2><p>Now I\u2019m inspired. I decide to take things to the next level. I open the blue pair and fit one of the slippers onto the end of a mop. I go after some webs in a ceiling corner of my bedroom \u2014 a little cluster only visible at night with the bed lamps, which I never remember to get in the day when I\u2019m cleaning. I nail it, then go room to room, slippers on my feet and one in the air, spot-cleaning all upper corners.<\/p><p>I come back with a very well-used mop slipper in need of a wash. I shake off the loose dirt outside, then drop it in the sink with the purple pair. Warm water, a drop of detergent, swish, swish, quick rinse. I ring out my mop slippers, then drape them on the shower rod. Because the soft poly is quick-drying, my mop slippers are ready for deployment a few hours later, good as new.<\/p><a href=\"https:\/\/shopping.yahoo.com\/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-lifestyle&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9TbGlwcGVycy1NaWNyb2ZpYmVyLUNsZWFuaW5nLUJhdGhyb29tLVBvbGlzaGluZy9kcC9CMDc5RFBIWVlYLz90YWc9eWxlMDEtcC1vLTM0My0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNWM0ODNmZjEtOWU5OS0zNDE2LWI0YjEtZmZmOWIzNTE5MjlmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXuzGEyJJZSD-0yWt6YaN05qLemvIc6HY71MVLXGpc3i&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSlippers-Microfiber-Cleaning-Bathroom-Polishing%2Fdp%2FB079DPHYYX%2F\"><figure><img alt=\"3 photos of person using mop slippers differently: by hand on the countertop, on their feet, and on a mop head\" data-uuid=\"48a40dd2-2d35-37ab-8b9e-44ca343cd84e\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_yahoo_life_260\/020f495619fe5b74bd0cb4e599f11f3f\"\/><figcaption>How do I love these?

        "description": "<p>ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Authorities continued to search Saturday for victims and survivors of a trawler that sank off the coast of Greece <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/migrants-shipwreck-rescue-greece-coast-guard-c160027a00d1ad2f859b97e3e8e7643d\">with as many as 750 migrants on board<\/a>, as conservative leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis blasted critics of the rescue operation.<\/p><p>Naysayers, Mitsotakis said at a campaign stop in the town of Sparta, should turn their ire against traffickers he called \u201chuman scum.\u201d The vessel sank on Wednesday.<\/p><p>The Greek coast guard announced Saturday that one Greek Navy frigate and four other vessels were operating 47 nautical miles (54 miles; 87 kilometers) southwest of the town of Pylos in Greece\u2019s southwest. Earlier, two helicopters from the navy and coast guard joined the operation, the coast guard said.<\/p><p>The rescue operation is taking place in rough seas, with near gale-force winds, and in some of the Mediterranean Sea&#39;s deepest waters. at over 5,000 meters (3 miles).&nbsp;<\/p><p>To date, 104 survivors have been rescued and 78 bodies have been recovered. The trawler carried as many as 750 men, women and children from Syria, Egypt, the Palestinian territories and Pakistan. No survivors or bodies have been found since the day of the accident.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The survivors have been taken to a migrant reception center outside Athens. A few have been visited by relatives residing in other European countries.<\/p><p>The Egyptian embassy in Athens on Saturday shared a list of 43 Egyptian migrants, including minors, who survived the shipwreck. The survivors are all men from Cairo and the Nile Delta provinces of Sharqia and Menofia, the list shows. The embassy said the list was provided by Greek authorities.<\/p><p>Greek authorities <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/migrants-shipwreck-rescue-greece-coast-guard-c160027a00d1ad2f859b97e3e8e7643d\">continue to face criticism<\/a>, however, over their failure to act more quickly. They say the migrants insisted they didn&#39;t need any help, but non-governmental organizations say they received a number of calls for help.&nbsp;<\/p><p>On Saturday, parts of the Greek rescue vessel captain&#39;s testimony were published by Greek media. In it he said the migrants refused help, saying they were going to Italy, and untied a rope loosely tied to the trawler&#39;s bow when the coast guard ship had gone closer to inspect.<\/p><p>\u201cIt is very unfair for some so-called \u2018people in solidarity\u2019 to insinuate that the (Coast Guard) did not do its job. ... These people are out there battling the waves to rescue human lives and protect our borders,\u201d Mitsotakis said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Mitsotakis, the favorite to win a second four-year term in elections on June 25, attacked the main opposition party Syriza for its own record on migration while in government.<\/p><p>\u201cThose who today appear as the so-called authentic humanitarians are those who allowed detention camps such as Moria to exist. The same who, a few days ago, were condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for the wretched conditions at Moria.\u201d<\/p><p>The notoriously overcrowded migrant camp of Moria, on the island of Lesbos across from the Turkish coast, opened in January 2013 under a three-party coalition government led by New Democracy. It saw its population swell during the migration crisis of 2015. It operated throughout the Syriza administration from 2015-19 and burned down in September 2020. Just before it did, it was estimated that 20,000 people lived in a camp designed to accommodate 3,000.<\/p><p>Mitsotakis also attacked Syriza for \u201copening the doors to millions of people\u201d in 2015 and defended his own more restrictive policies, vowing to continue them.<\/p><p>\u201cWe followed a different migration policy ... fair and strict, of monitoring and guarding our borders. A policy which resulted in illegal crossings dropping 90 percent,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThis policy has been acknowledged (by Europe) as the right one. Because if we leave Europe&#39;s borders to allow in everyone, then the numbers of those wanting to cross the Mediterranean will rise exponentially and so will the chances of tragic shipwrecks.\u201d<\/p><p>Separately on Saturday, a successful rescue operation took place in Italy, where a coast guard vessel from the port of Roccella, in Calabria, rescued 96 migrants on a sailboat more than 100 nautical miles (115 miles; 185 kilometers) from the port.<\/p><p>Turbulent seas made the rescue difficult but with the assistance of a Portuguese coast guard vessel operating for Frontex, the European Union&#39;s border agency, and several commercial vessels, the rescue was completed.<\/p><p>___<\/p><p>Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo and Nicole Winfield, in Rome, contributed to this report.<\/p>",

It measures the percentage of working-age households that are at risk of being financially unprepared for retirement.<\/p><p>Here\u2019s where it gets a bit messy. The Index\u2019s income assumptions figure people work to age 65, annuitize all their financial assets, and tap their home equity with a reverse mortgage on their homes.<\/p><p>The truth is most people are unlikely to do all of those things, so the percentage that falls behind may ultimately be far higher.<\/p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that the meaning of &quot;at risk&quot; differs by income, according to the researchers. At-risk households with very low income may have trouble affording basic necessities. In contrast, at-risk households with high income are probably not going to wind up broke. However, they do face the possibility of a drastically downsized lifestyle \u2014 especially since so many at risk are under the impression that they\u2019re not.<\/p><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_yahoo_finance_433\/e3612d2ea0baf0f698f99cf043de8b2d\" style=\"\" alt=\"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - MAY 05: Spectators wearing festive hats look on in the paddock ahead of the 149th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 05, 2023 in Louisville, Kentucky.

        "title": "Sudan officials say airstrike killed 17 people, including 5 children, in capital Khartoum",
        "description": "<p>CAIRO (AP) \u2014 An airstrike in Sudan\u2019s capital Khartoum on Saturday killed at least 17 people, including five children, health officials said, as fighting continued between rival generals seeking to control the country.<\/p><p>The attack was one of the deadliest of the clashes in urban areas of Khartoum and elsewhere in Sudan between the military and a powerful paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces.<\/p><p>There was no immediate comment Saturday from either side of the conflict on the strike, and it was not clear whether the attack was by warplanes or a drone. The military\u2019s aircraft have repeatedly targeted RSF troops and the RSF has reportedly used drones and anti-aircraft weapons against the military.<\/p><p>The <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/sudan\">fighting<\/a> broke out in mid-April, capping months of increasing tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF. The clashes have killed more than 3,000 people and wounded over 6,000 others, said Health Minister Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim in an interview late Saturday with the Saudi-owned television station, Al-Hadath.<\/p><p>Saturday\u2019s strike hit the Yormouk neighborhood in southern Khartoum, where clashes have centered in recent weeks, according to Sudan&#39;s Ministry of Health. The area houses a military facility controlled by the army. At least 25 houses were destroyed, the ministry wrote in a Facebook post.<\/p><p>The dead included five children and an unknown number of women and elderly people, and some wounded people were hospitalized, the ministry said.<\/p><p>A local group that calls itself The Emergency Room and helps organize humanitarian aid in the area, said at least 11 people were wounded in the strike. It posted images it said were of houses damaged in the attack and people searching through rubble. Other images claimed to show a wounded girl and man.<\/p><p>The United States and Saudi Arabia announced late Saturday that the warring sides agreed on a 72-hour cease-fire across the African country. The new cease-fire would take effect Sunday morning Khartoum time, according to a joint U.S.-Saudi statement.<\/p><p>The statement said both the military and the RSF agreed to stop fighting and \u201crefrain from seeking military advantage during the ceasefire.\u201d<\/p><p>The U.S. and Saudi Arabia urged the warring sides to fully implement the cease-fire, which comes ahead a pledging conference to fund the increasing humanitarian needs in the African country.<\/p><p>For weeks, Saudi Arabia and the United States <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/sudan-war-military-rsf-saudi-us-cease-fire-4ae80652d0f52361c62bf171dd29c68d\">have been mediating<\/a> between the warring parties. Multiple cease-fire agreements failed to stop the raging fighting across Sudan.<\/p><p>The conflict has plunged the African country into chaos and turned Khartoum and other urban areas into battlefields. The paramilitary force has occupied people\u2019s houses and other civilian properties since the onset of the conflict, according to residents and activists.<\/p><p>More than 2.2 million people have fled their homes to safer areas inside Sudan or crossed into neighboring countries, according to U.N. figures.<\/p><p>Activists and residents have reported widespread looting in the capital. Diplomatic missions, including residences belong to the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, have been stormed and looted, allegedly by armed men wearing RSF uniforms. Almost all diplomatic missions in Sudan were evacuated in the first weeks of the war.<\/p><p>\u201cLooting was fairly extensive at some of the residences,\u201d the U.S. Department of State told The Associated Press. \u201cThe damage was discovered during routine checks of the residences. There is some damage to the structures and personal property.\u201d<\/p><p>Sexual violence, including the rape of women and girls, has been reported in Khartoum and the western Darfur region, which have seen some of the worst fighting in the conflict. Almost all reported cases of sexual attacks were blamed on the RSF, which hasn&#39;t responded to repeated requests for comment.<\/p><p>The Darfur city of Genena has experienced some of the worst battles, with tens of thousands of its residents fleeing to neighboring Chad. The RSF and allied Arab militias have repeatedly attacked the city, especially areas of the non-Arab Masalit community, since late April, according to residents and activists.<\/p><p>The attacks intensified earlier this month. Volker Perthes, the U.N envoy in Sudan, said last week that the fighting in Genena has taken on \u201can ethnic dimension,\u201d with Arab militias and armed men in RSF uniforms showing &quot;an emerging pattern of large-scale targeted attacks against civilians based on their ethnic identities.\u201d<\/p><p>On Wednesday, West Darfur Gov. Khamis Abdalla Abkar, who hails from the Masalit, was abducted and killed hours after he accused the RSF and allied Arab militias in a televised interview of attacking Genena. His slaying was blamed on the RSF, a charge the paramilitary force denied.<\/p><p>Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the U.N.

        "description": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Speaker Kevin McCarthy&#39;s bid to appease Republican hard-liners and get the House moving again after a recent party rebellion on the floor has some Democrats warning of a difficult road ahead when it comes to passing legislation that will keep the government running.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Republicans teed up votes this past week on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/gun-stabilizing-brace-congress-republicans-5a1ee268735c400022ed83c3926667ef\">guns<\/a> and on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/house-censure-schiff-russia-investigation-trump-c3e7e2c3ce34a689f7c305581cb41b5a\">censuring<\/a> one of former President Donald Trump&#39;s most prominent critics, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Those votes helped get the House moving again, though the latter effort failed, with Schiff helped by some 20 Republicans.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The most consequential move of the week, however, was an announcement from GOP leadership that arrived with little fanfare. Republicans said they plan to pursue appropriations bills, which fund government programs and agencies, with less spending than the top-line numbers they agreed to in a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/debt-limit-biden-mccarthy-senate-house-default-b8c3566b0c9cb168d9706aa256e327f7\">deal<\/a> with the White House last month. That compromise avoided what would have been an unprecedented federal default.<\/p><p>McCarthy argued that the numbers he negotiated with the White House amount to a cap and \u201cyou can always do less.\u201d GOP Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, who leads the House Appropriations Committee, followed with a statement that said she would seek to limit nondefense spending at 2022 budget levels, saying the debt agreement \u201cset a top-line spending cap -\u2013 a ceiling, not a floor.\u201d<\/p><p>The announcements delighted Republicans who had criticized McCarthy, R-Calif., and opposed the debt ceiling legislation because they felt that agreement allowed too much spending. But it drew immediate pushback from Democrats who say an attempt to circumvent the debt ceiling agreement&#39;s top-line numbers effectively guarantees a standoff with the Senate and White House and possibly even a damaging government stoppage when funding expires this fall.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cIt is a prelude to a shutdown \u2014 what they are engineering,\u201d said Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The emerging dynamic raises the potential for another round of economy-rattling brinkmanship in Washington just months after lawmakers narrowly avoided a damaging federal default.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Partial government shutdowns have become increasingly common in the modern era, with the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/north-america-donald-trump-government-shutdown-legislation-ap-top-news-30769167ab7a4ef9adf880d020b775dd\">longest<\/a> coming under President Donald Trump as he demanded money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. With President Joe Biden facing down the Republican-controlled House as he runs for reelection in 2024 and some conservatives openly dismissive of the damage a shutdown can cause, the spending fight appears nearly certain to escalate.<\/p><p>The tension created by the GOP&#39;s pursuit of more non-defense spending cuts was evident during hearings held Wednesday and Thursday of the House Appropriations panel.<\/p><p>Democrats accused House Republicans of going back on their word. \u201cDo you think any of us would have made a deal if we thought your \u201822 number was the deal?&quot; said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. &quot;What kind of deal is that? What kind of respect for yourselves is that?&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cYou knew that wasn&#39;t a ceiling,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. \u201cTraditionally, that&#39;s where we are starting. Caps are not ceilings in our world. They are a starting point and then we negotiate from those numbers we have agreed to. That&#39;s how it has always been.\u201d<\/p><p>But Republicans said McCarthy was clear during negotiations that spending had to come down from current levels.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cWe can try to fool the American people with smoke and mirrors and pretend, but the speaker was clear. We are in a debt crisis in this country,\u201d said Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Under the debt ceiling agreement, the White House said nondefense spending was expected to be roughly flat in the next budget year and increase by 1% the following year. Defense spending would increase by about 3.3% next year and 1% the following year. The agreement to curb discretionary spending does not include programs like Medicare and Social Security, which are considered mandatory spending.<\/p><p>A few Republicans have urged leadership not to bend to a minority within the conference.<\/p><p>\u201cI think we&#39;ve just got to be really careful not to allow, you know, a small portion of our conference to continually be chipping away at previously agreed upon issues,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark. \u201cThat top-line number was agreed to in the (debt-ceiling bill.) They may not like it. They voiced their displeasure last week. They kind of shut the House down, but we&#39;ve got work to do. We need to be doing it.\u201d<\/p><p>Republicans only have a five-seat majority in the House, which magnifies the power that a small bloc can have. It took just 11 members, mostly members of the House Freedom Caucus, to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/house-republicans-speaker-mccarthy-gas-stoves-efe22cb525349daf704828ad777b403e\">stall<\/a> House votes on legislation in early June and send lawmakers home early. One of those 11, Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., said moving to 2022 spending levels for nondefense programs will be good for Republican candidates in next year&#39;s general election because that&#39;s what voters are demanding.<\/p><p>\u201cDemocrats have no interest in cutting spending,\u201d Good said. \u201cThey have to be forced to do so. We should have used the debt ceiling to force them to cut spending. We should use the appropriations process to force them to cut spending. We shouldn&#39;t fear a government shutdown. Most of what we do up here is bad anyway.&quot;<\/p><p>Many senators, Democrat and Republican, did not seem as concerned about the possibility of a shutdown.<\/p><p>\u201cThis crowd that is giving McCarthy trouble is irrelevant for purposes of getting appropriations bills passed,&quot; said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cWhen it comes to appropriations bills, you have to create a coalition that doesn&#39;t include the Freedom Caucus.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cIn the end, I think we&#39;ll resolve these issues,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>Saudi-backed LIV Golf and the PGA Tour filed a motion late Friday to dismiss their antitrust lawsuit and countersuits, ending more than 10 months and enormous legal fees in a bitter dispute that turned into a business agreement.<\/p><p>The filing in a northern California federal court was more procedural than a surprise.&nbsp;<\/p><p>It was a big part of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/liv-golf-pga-europeann-tour-saudi-arabia-a316315863e88d3f69b763fbdc82ebe0\">the stunning June 6 agreement<\/a> in which the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, the PGA Tour and the European tour became partners in a new for-profit company for commercial businesses.<\/p><p>The PGA Tour sent a notice to players, which was obtained by The Associated Press, that said, \u201cPursuant to the Framework Agreement announced last week, documents have now been filed with the court bringing a formal end to all pending litigation between the PGA Tour, PIF and LIV Golf.\u201d<\/p><p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that tour executives told the staff legal fees were closing in on $50 million. As part of the motion, all sides are responsible for their legal fees.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Along with ending the antitrust complaints against each other, the motion asks for dismissal of an appeal involving whether the PIF and its governor, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, would have to provide testimony.<\/p><p>The PIF and Al-Rumayyan were trying to claim an exemption from the Foreign Service Immunity Act. A federal magistrate had ruled they were not exempt because of the PIF&#39;s involvement in the commercial enterprise of LIV Golf.<\/p><p>All requests were to dismiss with prejudice, meaning neither side&#39;s lawsuit can be reopened.<\/p><p>Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau were among 11 players who sued the PGA Tour in early August when they were suspended for defecting to LIV Golf. The rival league paid signing fees of $100 million or more, in addition to the $25 million in prize money for 48-man fields with guaranteed money at every tournament.<\/p><p>The lawsuit claimed the PGA Tour has used monopoly power to try to squash competition. The PGA Tour won an early court decision when a federal judge denied a temporary restraining order that would have let three LIV Golf players to compete in the tour&#39;s postseason.<\/p><p>LIV Golf joined the lawsuit and eventually all 11 players pulled out of the lawsuit.<\/p><p>The PGA Tour filed a countersuit in September accusing LIV of \u201ctortious interference&quot; by inducing top players to breach contracts by claiming the tour could not enforce its rules.<\/p><p>Any jury trial was not expected until the middle of 2024 at the earliest as both sides wrangled over discovery issues.<\/p><p>But the case is not done yet. The New York Times earlier on Friday filed a motion to intervene, asking the court to unseal documents. The Times says the public&#39;s right to the information outweighs the tour and LIV Golf&#39;s claims certain documents could cause \u201ccompetitive harm.\u201d<\/p><p>That request is to be heard on Aug. 3.<\/p><p>Also, the Justice Department <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/liv-golf-pga-tour-justice-department-antitrust-95686bda6ad5e080609de16ac5b8ac6f\">has begun to examine<\/a> the agreement between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf&#39;s Saudi backers to determine whether it violates federal antitrust statutes. The agreement contained few details on how the new company will operate and what becomes of LIV Golf, which is in its second season.<\/p><p>___<\/p><p>AP golf: <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/golf\">https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/golf<\/a> and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AP_Sports\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/AP_Sports<\/a><\/p>",

By that time Jackson was dead.<\/p><p>The sheriff\u2019s office received multiple 911 calls about a bear mauling someone around 7:50 a.m., and deputies as well as police and animal control officers from nearby Prescott responded, officials said.<\/p><p>Jackson had been at the campsite in the Groom Creek area for some time, and it was not unusual for him to be at the property, the sheriff\u2019s office said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>There doesn\u2019t appear to have been any food or anything else obvious that would have attracted a bear, it said.<\/p><p>Officials are confident that the bear responsible was killed, and there is no threat of other aggressive animals to the public.<\/p><p>The bear that attacked Jackson is estimated to be 6 to 10 years old, but more investigation was ongoing, Darren Tucker, a field supervisor for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>A necropsy, or an autopsy conducted on an animal, will also be done, he said.<\/p><p>Sightings of bears around the Prescott area are common, and there is a robust population of black bears in the state, but Tucker said attacks like Friday&#39;s are &quot;super rare.&quot; He believed the last fatal bear attack in the state was in 2011.<\/p><p>Bears and mountain lions are also caught on doorbell cameras and other home surveillance video, he said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&quot;We have had zero reports of any kind of aggressive or threatening behavior from a bear anywhere around here,&quot; Tucker said.<\/p><p>The sheriff sought to remind the public Friday that they cannot shoot bears unless the bear is a threat to themselves or someone else.<\/p><p>\u201cThese are exceeding rare circumstances and we haven\u2019t seen this before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to freak out, shoot bears, shoot animals.\u201d<\/p><p>The Groom Creek area is a heavily wooded area around 5 miles south of Prescott, a city north of Phoenix,<\/p>",

The NBA found his conduct problematic enough to issue two suspensions, though. As Silver&#39;s statement said, &quot;The potential for other young people to emulate Ja\u2019s conduct is particularly concerning.&quot;<\/p><p>Still, there is an absence of specifics in this instance, especially considering the &quot;additional information&quot; Silver alluded to before the Finals.

The couple and their 13-year-old child were reportedly in search of a home to buy in Beasley&#39;s neighborhood.<\/p><p>Former NBA player Stephen Jackson was suspended 30 games in 2004 for entering the stands and punching a fan in defense of Indiana Pacers teammate Ron Artest. Jackson&#39;s ban for firing a gun outside a nightclub in 2007 was just seven games. The commissioner then was David Stern, but the NBA&#39;s policies for doling out punishment have always been difficult to decipher. Compare Morant&#39;s suspension to the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nba-suspends-ex-hornets-f-miles-bridges-for-30-games-10-months-after-domestic-violence-arrest-192237388.html\">30 games<\/a> free-agent forward Miles Bridges just received for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/adam-silver-defends-miles-bridges-de-facto-10-game-suspension-says-nba-had-agreement-for-him-to-not-play-in-2022-23-174219855.html\">pleading no contest to a felony domestic violence charge<\/a> (albeit following a year in which he was not signed as a direct result of his alleged criminal behavior).<\/p><p>Morant brandished a gun on camera. There is no easy answer for how he should have to answer for that.<\/p><p>Another aspect of Morant&#39;s suspension appears to be that he has repeated this offense. When Morant wielded a firearm on Instagram Live from a Colorado strip club in March, Silver said the All-NBA guard &quot;made it clear to me that he has learned from this incident and that he understands his obligations and responsibility to the Memphis Grizzlies and the broader NBA community.&quot; Morant broke that trust in May.<\/p><div id=\"e6c18757976c439c971308d3fc860948\"><iframe height=\"220px\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/art19.com\/shows\/492879e0-37f8-45f6-8a18-f6a441f6c9bb\/episodes\/39e170c0-f489-405e-81a6-928845669d78\/embed?theme=light-custom&amp;primary_color=%236001d2\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>As Silver said Friday, &quot;Ja Morant\u2019s decision to once again wield a firearm on social media is alarming and disconcerting given his similar conduct in March for which he was already suspended eight games.&quot; The statement continued, &quot;Prior to his return to play, he will be required to formulate and fulfill a program with the league that directly addresses the circumstances that led him to repeat this destructive behavior.&quot;<\/p><p>The players&#39; union countered with a strong rebuke of how the league seems to be policing behavior of unionized employees outside work that the actual police will not.<\/p><p>&quot;As to the discipline imposed, which keeps [Morant] off the court until December and requires some unstated conditions to be met before he can return, we believe it is excessive and inappropriate for a number of reasons including the facts involved in this particular incident, and that it is not fair and consistent with past discipline in our league,&quot; NBPA executive director Tamika Tremaglio said in a statement Friday. &quot;We will explore with Ja all options and next steps.&quot;<\/p><p>Morant offered no indication that he intended to appeal the suspension in <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wojespn\/status\/1669726645224189958\">his own statement<\/a> Friday. He apologized to the league, the Grizzlies, his fans and sponsors, adding, &quot;I hope you&#39;ll give me the chance to prove to you over time I&#39;m a better man than what I&#39;ve been showing you.&quot; He has made similar statements before and broken the same promise. He may well let the NBPA debate the morality of that on his behalf.<\/p><p>Does the NBA think it can punish someone into being a better man? Should the NBA be in the business of prioritizing the righteousness of its players? Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green faced no penalty from the league for punching teammate Jordan Poole in the face at a team facility. If a 25-game suspension results in Morant&#39;s improved well-being, all the better, but that&#39;s another matter entirely.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The corporate parent of Facebook and Instagram plans to open a digital gateway for kids as young as 10 years old to enter virtual reality through the Meta Quest headset, despite rising concerns about children spending too much time on social media.<\/p><p>Meta Platforms, which oversees a social media empire created by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, disclosed it will lower the minimum age for a Quest account <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/blog\/quest\/meta-accounts-parent-managed-families\/\">from 13 years old to 10 years old in a Friday blog post<\/a>. The Menlo Park, California, company framed the change coming later this year as a family-friendly way for more people to explore artificial realms that Zuckerberg touts as the \u201cmetaverse.\u201d<\/p><p>The move to lure preteens into a virtual world filled with digital avatars and other technological fabrications comes just weeks after <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/social-media-tips-children-surgeon-general-ad87529f4a6a762e3162f59db1f4709c\">U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called upon tech companies and lawmakers<\/a> to take steps to protect children from the potentially harmful mental and emotional effects of too much exposure to social media.<\/p><p>Both Facebook and Instagram for years have been under fire for using tactics that get kids hooked on social media at a young age, undercutting their real-life relationships with friends and families while exposing them to the risk of online bullying and abuse by sexual predators.<\/p><p>In its blog post, Meta said that parents will retain control over their children&#39;s accounts for the Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets and promised that preteen access will be limited to \u201cage-appropriate\u201d apps deploying virtual reality, or VR. Preteens won&#39;t be able to have a Quest account without explicit approval from their parents and all apps used on the platform will require parental consent, too, according to the company, which is recommending the younger age group be limited to a two-hour daily time limit on the headset.<\/p><p>Other safeguards will include setting all preteen accounts to a private setting by default and a pledge not to show them any ads that generate most of Meta&#39;s revenue.<\/p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re building this with our <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/about.meta.com\/metaverse\/responsible-innovation\/?intern_source=blog&intern_content=meta-accounts-parent-managed-families\">Responsible Innovation Principles<\/a> and our commitment to building safe, positive experiences for young people at the forefront,\u201d Meta wrote in the blog post.<\/p><p>The company also is <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t39.8562-6\/354616813_241144075285957_6147518446528089600_n.pdf?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad8a9d&_nc_ohc=Zu9QrS4s2zoAX8_r2qX&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AfA3mftKCsNmVv2f4c1Ffr6ymVw9Xy0kUel-xarjShrFZg&oe=6492325F\">providing parents with extensive guidance<\/a> when assessing whether they should allow a 10- to -12-year-old to use a virtual reality headset. One section of the guide cites \u201ca growing body of research examining the positive effects of VR in medical\/clinical contexts, including interventions to support the development of social competence skills, to distract from painful or anxiety-inducing medical procedures, and to support specific skill development in specialized populations,&quot; such as children with cerebral palsy.<\/p><p>By expanding the potential audience for the Quest, Zuckerberg appears to be taking another significant step toward his goal of sculpting the metaverse into a sphere that eventually will be as popular as Facebook and Instagram have become since he started the company in a college dorm room nearly 20 years ago.<\/p><p>The metaverse so far has mostly been a digital ghost town, even though millions of Quest headsets have been sold. The Meta division that oversees the Quest headset and metaverse lost $13.7 billion last year while bringing in $2.2 billion in revenue.<\/p><p>What&#39;s more, Meta is facing formidable new competition from Apple, which last week <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/apple-headset-googles-virtual-augmented-reality-technology-dc524172ada659536dbeed5f5efb11fa\">unveiled a headset called Vision Pro<\/a> that&#39;s capable of thrusting users into virtual settings, too. The high-end headset, priced at $3,500, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/apple-vision-pro-headset-mixed-reality-9f81b5cb055f601ea2f40e4a93a54f14\">received enthusiastic responses in carefully staged demos<\/a>, but it won&#39;t be in stores until some time early next year.<\/p><p>Meta already has announced the next Quest headset will cost $500 as a way to get more people to buy it before the Vision Pro is released and now is taking steps to get preteens on board.<\/p>",
